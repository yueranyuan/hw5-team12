Simpson1, David W. Fardo2, Steven Estus1*1 Department of Physiology and Sanders-Brown Center on Aging, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, United States of America, 2 Department of Biostatistics, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, United States of AmericaAbstract Top The minor allele of rs11136000 within CLU is strongly associated with reduced Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. The mechanism underlying this association is unclear. Here, we report that CLU1 and CLU2 are the two primary CLU isoforms in human brain; CLU1 and CLU2 share exons 2–9 but differ in exon 1 and proximal promoters. The expression of both CLU1 and CLU2 was increased in individuals with significant AD neuropathology. However, only CLU1 was associated with the rs11136000 genotype, with the minor “protective” rs11136000T allele being associated with increased CLU1 expression. Since CLU1 and CLU2 are predicted to encode intracellular and secreted proteins, respectively, we compared their expression; for both CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells, clusterin is present in the secretory pathway, accumulates in the extracellular media, and is similar in size to clusterin in human brain. Overall, we interpret these results as indicating that the AD-protective minor rs11136000T allele is associated with increased CLU1 expression. Since CLU1 and CLU2 appear to produce similar proteins and are increased in AD, the AD-protection afforded by the rs11136000T allele may reflect increased soluble clusterin throughout life.Citation: Ling I-F, Bhongsatiern J, Simpson JF, Fardo DW, Estus S (2012) Genetics of Clusterin Isoform Expression and Alzheimer's Disease Risk.

Although the primary role of clusterin in AD is unclear, CLU is implicated in AD by several lines of evidence, including (I) CLU mRNA and clusterin protein is increased in AD [5], [6], (ii) clusterin is a component of plaques [4], [5], [7], (iii) clusterin modulates AD-related pathways such as inflammation and apoptosis [1], [8], [9] and (iv) clusterin acts as an amyloid-beta (Aß) chaperone to alter Aß aggregation and/or clearance ([10], [11], reviewed in [4], [12], [13], [14]). The physiologic relevance of CLU to AD was confirmed recently when CLU single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)s were associated with AD risk [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]. Overall, CLU genetic variation is essentially unequivocally associated with AD given the robust statistical power of the initial genome-wide association studies and subsequent replication studies [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]. How CLU SNPs modulate clusterin to alter AD risk is unknown.Two CLU isoforms, CLU1 and CLU2, have been reported that consist of nine exons and differ only in their first exons and associated proximal promoters; CLU1 is predicted to encode a nuclear protein and CLU2 a secreted protein (reviewed in [20]). Additional reported isoforms include a CLU isoform that lacks exon 5 and a CLU isoform that lacks exon two, which encodes the leader sequence, resulting in another nuclear clusterin [21], [22]. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that CLU isoforms are differentially modulated by AD status and AD-associated SNPs. We identified CLU1 and CLU2 as the major CLU isoforms in human brain. Quantitative expression studies show that both CLU1 and CLU2 are increased in AD but only CLU1 is associated with rs11136000. Lastly, although CLU1 and CLU2 are predicted to produce intracellular and secreted proteins, respectively, immunofluorescence and Western blot studies indicate that CLU1 and CLU2 both produce secreted proteins that are similar to those detected in the human brain. Overall, we interpret our results as suggesting that SNP-mediated increases in secreted, soluble clusterin expression may act to reduce AD risk.Methods Top Ethics StatementThe work described here was performed with approval from the University of Kentucky Institutional Review Board.Cell CultureSH-SY5Y (human neuroblastoma) and HepG2 (human hepatocellular carcinoma) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 µg/ml streptomycin at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 - 95% air atmosphere.CLU Expression PlasmidExpression plasmids encoding CLU1 and CLU2 were generated from SH-SY5Y cellular mRNA that was reverse transcribed by using the primer 5′-TAGGTGCAAAAGCAACAT-3′ which corresponds to sequence just after the CLU stop codon. CLU1 and CLU2 cDNAs were then amplified by PCR with forward primers 5′-TGAGTCATGCAGGTTTGCAG-3′ (CLU1) and 5′-ATGATGAAGACTCTGCTGCTG-3′ (CLU2) used in combination with the common reverse primer 5′-CTCCTCCCGGTGCTTTTTG-3′. PCR fragments were ligated into pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO T/A cloning vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Clones encoding CLU1 and CLU2 were detected by PCR screening and clone integrity confirmed by sequencing.Human Autopsy TissueDe-identified human brain specimens were provided by the University of Kentucky AD Center Neuropathology Core [23], [24]. AD and non-AD designations followed NIARI neuropathology guidelines, which include indices of neuritic senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, and provide a likelihood staging of AD neuropathological diagnosis [25], [26]. Individuals with “low” AD neuropathology were cognitively intact prior to death and had no or low likelihood of AD by NIARI criteria; their average age at death was 81.8±10.2 (mean ±SD, n = 17). Individuals with “high” AD neuropathology represented a combination of demented individuals with high likelihood of AD by NIARI criteria (n = 27) and cognitively intact individuals that were found to have moderate or high AD neuropathology at death (n = 7); their average age at death was 81.9±6.2 (mean ±SD, n = 34). The average post-mortem interval (PMI) for low AD neuropathology individuals was 3.0±0.8 hours (mean ± SD, n = 17) while the PMI for high AD neuropathology individuals was similar (3.2±0.8 hours (n = 34)). Choroid plexus samples were from six individuals with an average age at death of 80.0± 3.3 years and PMI of 2.9±1.1 hours. Fetal tissue RNA samples were obtained commercially (Stratagene, Santa Clara, CA) and have been described previously [27].PCR AmplificationTotal RNA was extracted from human brain specimens and converted to cDNA in 1 µg aliquots with random hexamers and reverse transcriptase (SuperScript III, Invitrogen), essentially as we described previously [24], [28], [29], [30]. PCR primers were designed such that the splicing of each internal CLU exon as well as CLU1 and CLU2 were evaluated (Table 1). In initial screening, cDNA pooled from five high AD neuropathology and five low AD neuropathology samples were subjected to PCR-amplification (Platinum Taq, Invitrogen) by using each primer pair and a PCR profile consisting of initial denaturation for 5 minutes at 95°C, followed by 27–32 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 60°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 1 min, and final extension at 72°C for 7 min (Perkin Elmer 9600). PCR products were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, stained with SYBR Gold and visualized by using a fluorescence imager (Fuji FLA-2000). The identity of the PCR products was confirmed by direct sequencing (Davis Sequencing, Davis, CA).thumbnailTable 1. PCR Primers for evaluating splice variation.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0033923.t001 Real-time PCRThe expression level of CLU1 and CLU2 was quantified by real-time PCR. Each isoform was specifically amplified by using a sense primer corresponding to sequence within their respective exon 1, i.e., 5′-GCGAGCAGAGCGCTATAAAT-3′ for CLU1 and 5′-AGATGGATTCGGTGTGAAGG-3′ for CLU2′, and an antisense primer corresponding to sequence at the exon 2–3 boundary, i.e., 5′-GACATTTCCTGGAGCTCATTG-3′. Note that the CLU1 sense primer contains the TATA sequence suggested by Schepeler et al to be present only in a longer “CLU34” isoform [31]. The 20 µl real-time PCR mixture containing approximately 20 ng of brain cDNA, 1 µM of each primer and 1× PerfecTaq PCRSupermix (Quanta Biosciences, Gaithersburg, MD) was subjected to real-time PCR (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). PCR profiles consisted of pre-incubation at 95°C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, 60°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 20 s. Specificity of the reactions was evaluated by showing a single PCR product by gel electrophoresis and by performing a melting curve analysis after PCR amplification. The PCR product copy number in each sample was determined relative to standard curves that were amplified in parallel and were based upon previously purified and quantified PCR products. The copy numbers were then normalized to the geometric mean of the copy numbers of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 and ribosomal protein L13A as described (Vandesompele et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2005). All real-time PCR assays were repeated twice.GenotypingDNA samples were genotyped for rs11136000 by using unlabeled PCR primers and TaqMan FAM and VIC dye-labeled MGB probes (Pre-designed SNP Genotyping Assay, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) on a real-time PCR machine (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).Statistical AnalysisVariation in CLU isoform expression were analyzed as a function of rs11136000 genotype, AD neuropathology, sex and age by using a general linear model (SPSS v.18 (IBM, Somers, NY)). A dominant mode of inheritance was assumed to maximize statistical power.ImmunofluorescenceCLU expression plasmids were transfected into SH-SY5Y cells by using FuGene HD Transfection Reagent as directed by the manufacturer (Roche Applied Sciences, Indianapolis, IN). Briefly, 3.75×104 cells/well were maintained in a poly-L-lysine treated 8-well chamber coverglass (Lab-Tek, Nunc, Rochester, NY) and transfected the next day with CLU1 or CLU2 expression plasmid. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with ice-cold methanol for 5 minutes. Non-specific antibody binding sites were blocked by incubating the cells with 5% goat serum in PBS with 0.1% Tween-20 (PBST) for 1 hour and the cells were then incubated with mouse anti-V5 antibody (1:1000 dilution, ab27671, Abcam, Cambridge, MA) and either rabbit anti-calnexin antibody (1:200 dilution, SPA-860, Stressgen, Victoria, BC, Canada) or rabbit anti-TGN46 antibody (1:1000 dilution, ab16052, Abcam) in 5% goat serum at 4°C overnight. The next day, cells were washed with PBST three times and incubated with a mixture containing Alexa-488 goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:200 dilution, Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA) and Alexa-568 goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:200 dilution, Molecular Probes) in 5% goat serum at room temperature for an hour. After washing with PBST, cells were stained with 10 µg/ml of Hoechst 33258 (Molecular Probes) for 30 minutes, washed with PBS, and subjected to fluorescence microscopy.Western BlotSH-SY5Y cells or HepG2 cells were grown in a 100 mm dish (2.6×106 cells/dish) for 24 hours and then transfected with CLU1 or CLU2 expression plasmid by using FuGene HD Transfection Reagent as directed by the manufacturer (Roche Applied Sciences). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cell medium was replaced with Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) and cells maintained for another 24 hours. The conditioned medium was collected and the cells washed with 5 ml of room-temperature PBS. Cells were then lysed in 0.5 ml of RIPA butter (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS) containing 1× protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Applied Sciences) for 30 minutes on ice with occasional rocking. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000×g for 10 minutes at 4°C and the supernatant collected. Conditioned medium was centrifuged at 250×g for 10 minutes and 0.5 ml of the supernatant was collected and supplemented with 1× protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Applied Science). Human brain anterior cingulate tissue samples were prepared by homogenizing ~0.5 mg tissue in RIPA buffer supplemented with 1× protease inhibitor cocktail, centrifuging at 14,000×g for 10 minutes at 4°C, and then collecting the supernatant. After the protein concentration of each sample was determined (Micro BCA Protein Assay Reagent Kit, Pierce, Rockford, IL), 15 or 20 µg protein were mixed with SDS sample loading buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol, boiled for 5 minutes and subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). The blots were then incubated with 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 hour at room temperature and probed overnight with mouse anti-V5 antibody (1:5000 dilution, Abcam) or mouse anti-clusterin antibody (1:200, B-5 Santa-Cruz) at 4°C. After washing with PBST four times for 5 minutes each, the blots were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse antibody (1:1,000 dilution, Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 hour at room temperature. Bound peroxidase was visualized by using a SuperSignal West Pico kit (Pierce) and a molecular imager (ChemiDoc XRS System, Bio-Rad). For studies involving PNGase F digestion, each protein sample was treated with PNGase F as directed by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). Briefly, 15 µg protein of each sample was denatured at 100°C for 10 minutes and incubated with 1,500 units of PNGase F at 37°C for 2 hours. Samples were then analyzed by Western blot as described above.Results Top To begin to evaluate CLU expression, we screened human brain cDNA to identify CLU isoforms present in brain. Previously reported isoforms include CLU1 and CLU2, which are identical in exons 2–9 but differ in exon 1, as well as isoforms lacking exons 2 or 5 ([21], [22], reviewed in [20]). RT-PCR analyses of pooled human brain cDNA samples detected only CLU1 and CLU2 (Figure 1A–1B). CLU2 translation is predicted to result in a secreted protein, beginning at the initial ATG in exon 2 that is common to both CLU2 and CLU1 (Figure 1C). In contrast, CLU1 translation is predicted to initiate at an ATG within its exon 1, which is in-frame with the ATG site in the common exon 2. Hence, CLU1 is predicted to encode a protein identical to that encoded by CLU2 except that the CLU1 protein would contain 52 additional amino acids at its amino terminus (Figure 1C). This change is predicted by PSORTII to result in an intracellular and likely nuclear, form of clusterin (reviewed in [20]). In summary, CLU1 and CLU2 are the primary CLU isoforms in brain and are predicted to encode intracellular and secreted proteins, respectively.thumbnailFigure 1. CLU1 and CLU2 are the primary CLU isoforms expressed in human brain.The exon layout for the CLU1 and CLU2 isoforms is shown (A). Coding and non-coding exonic regions are represented by black and white boxes, respectively, while introns are shown as thin black lines. The first ATG site in each isoform is shown as well. Evaluation of CLU splicing by RT-PCR identified only CLU1 and CLU2 in human brain cDNA (B), i.e., single PCR products are observed upon amplification from exon 1a – exon 5 (lane 1), exon 1b – exon 5 (lane 2), exon 4 – exon 6 (lane 3) and exon 5 – exon 9 (lane 4). Molecular weight markers are shown at the left. The predicted protein sequences encoded by CLU1 and CLU2, beginning with the initial ATG sites shown in A, are shown in panel C. The sequence in gray font is unique to CLU1 while sequence in black font is common to CLU1 and CLU2. The boxed amino acid sequence represents signal sequence that is removed from clusterin-2 upon its translocation to the ER. Two nuclear localization sequences, as predicted by PSORT II (http://psort.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/form2.htm l), are underlined. The asterisk shows the clusterin cleavage site that separates the α- and β- subunits.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0033923.g001 To evaluate whether rs11136000, the primary AD-related CLU SNP [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], is associated with CLU expression, we quantified CLU1 and CLU2 expression in a series of brain samples. The CLU isoforms were quantified in separate real-time PCR assays that used forward primers corresponding to their unique exon 1 and a common reverse primer that targeted the exon 2–3 boundary. Copy numbers were determined relative to a standard curve for each isoform and normalized to the geometric mean of housekeeping genes [23], [32]. The expression of CLU1 and CLU2 were modestly coordinately regulated (Figure 2A), with CLU2 being consistently greater than CLU1; the overall CLU2: CLU1 ratio was 3.35±1.84 (mean ± SD, n = 51). To gain further insights into CLU isoform expression, we quantified CLU1 and CLU2 in a series of single human fetal tissue samples as well as a set of six adult choroid plexus samples (Figure 2B). Among the fetal tissues, the CLU2: CLU1 ratio varied widely from 0.3 (skin) to 6.2 (kidney) (Figure 2B). The CLU2:CLU1 ratio in choroid plexus, which produces cerebrospinal fluid, was 5.72±0.65 (mean ± SD, n = 6).thumbnailFigure 2. Expression of CLU isoforms in human tissues.CLU1 and CLU2 isoforms were quantified by isoform-specific RT-PCR in a series of adult human cingulate and choroid plexus samples (A–B) as well as a human fetal tissues (B). Within A, each marker reflects the expression of CLU1 and CLU2, normalized to housekeeping genes, in a single brain sample. Within B, the value in parentheses following the tissue name is the CLU1:CLU2 ratio. CLU1 expression shows a positive association with AD neuropathology and rs11136000T allele (C). CLU2 expression was increased in individuals with AD pathology and decreased with age (D–E).doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0033923.g002 We next evaluated CLU isoform expression as a function of AD neuropathology, rs11136000 status, sex and age. We found that CLU1 expression was significantly increased with high AD neuropathology and the minor rs11136000T allele (Figure 2C, Table 2). In contrast, CLU2 expression was significantly increased with AD neuropathology but not rs11136000 genotype, and decreased with age (Figure 2D–E, Table 3). Overall, both CLU1 and CLU2 expression was increased with AD, confirming prior reports. However, only CLU1 expression was associated with rs11136000. Since the minor rs11136000T allele was associated with both increased CLU1 expression and reduced AD risk [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], we interpret these results as suggesting that increased CLU1 expression is associated with reduced AD risk.thumbnailTable 2. Analysis of CLU1 Expression.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0033923.t002 thumbnailTable 3. Analysis of CLU2 Expression.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0033923.t003 CLU1 and CLU2 are predicted to encode intracellular and secreted proteins, respectively (Figure 1). Therefore, we evaluated the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells to discern whether these corresponded to the intracellular and secreted forms of clusterin that have been reported [4], [8], [33]. When each isoform was transiently transfected into neural SH-SY5Y cells, immunofluorescence analyses showed a similar subcellular localization pattern (Figure 3). The proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 tended to concentrate within the Golgi apparatus, as established by double-labeling with an antibody against trans-Golgi network protein 46 (TGN46) (Figure 3A). Relatively modest amounts of clusterin were also detected within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), as established by double labeling with calnexin (Figure 3B). Nuclear, cytosolic, or mitochondrial-associated clusterin was not observed. Hence, the clusterin produced by CLU1 and CLU2 manifests an intracellular localization that includes the ER and Golgi, consistent with a possible secretory pathway for both proteins.thumbnailFigure 3. CLU1 and CLU2 encoded proteins are localized to the ER and Golgi.SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with vectors encoding CLU1 and CLU2; the resultant clusterin expression was localized by a vector-derived V5 epitope tag. The subcellular localization for both proteins overlapped with the Golgi, as shown by co-labeling with antibody against TGN46 (A) and with the ER, as shown by co-labeling with an antibody against calnexin (B).doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0033923.g003 CLU1 is predicted to encode a 501 amino acid protein with a molecular weight of 57.8 kDa while CLU2 is predicted to encode 449 amino acids, totaling 52.5 kDa. During maturation of secreted clusterin, the protein is N-glycosylated and proteolyzed to generate a heterodimer that is maintained by disulfide bonds [20]. To compare the size of the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2, we performed Western blot analyses of transfected SH-SY5Y cells; ectopic clusterin was detected via a V5 epitope tag (Figure 4 A–B). Cell lysates contained both intact and cleaved clusterin while conditioned medium contained only cleaved clusterin; the clusterin protein produced by CLU1 and CLU2 appeared equal in size (Figure 4A). To discern whether glycosylation differences may obscure differences in the clusterin molecular weight derived from their primary sequence, the protein mixtures were digested with PNGase F to remove N-linked sugars prior to electrophoresis; the size of the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells were both decreased similarly by PNGase treatment (Figure 4B). We considered the possibility that CLU translation may show cell-type specificity, and therefore repeated this study in an unrelated cell line by transfecting CLU1 and CLU2 into HepG2 cells. As with the SH-SY5Y cells, CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells produced clusterin of similar size, even after PNGase F digestion (Figure 4C). Hence, we found no evidence to suggest that the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 differ in cellular localization, size, glycosylation, or proteolytic cleavage. Rather, when these Western blot studies are considered in combination with the immunofluorescence studies, CLU1 and CLU2 appear to produce equivalent proteins that are similarly translated, glycosylated, and cleaved as they pass through the ER and Golgi in the secretory pathway to the extracellular space.thumbnailFigure 4. CLU1 and CLU2 produce clusterin proteins that are similar to each other and to clusterin in human brain.Transfection of CLU1 and CLU2 resulted in proteins of similar size, appearing as both intact and cleaved clusterin in cell lysates and conditioned media; the proteins resulting from CLU transfection were detected via their V5 epitope tag (A–B). PNGase F treatment prior to electrophoresis reduced the size of the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 similarly (B). The apparent doublet in the protein encoded by CLU1 at 37 kDa was variable between experiments and likely reflects incomplete glycosylation as the doublet collapsed to a single band after PNGase F digestion. Results similar to those depicted in B were obtained when CLU1 and CLU2 were transfected into HepG2 cells (C). When transfected and endogenous clusterin proteins were detected with an antibody raised against a carboxyl-terminal clusterin epitope (D–E), intact clusterin from transfection (T-labeled arrow) was slightly larger than endogenous clusterin (E-labeled arrow), reflecting the ~5.1 kDa V5 epitope and His tags in the ectopic clusterin (D). The bands labeled “Fragments” are clusterin alpha subunits derived from variably glycosylated endogenous and transfected clusterin. Overall, the cellular clusterin proteins are similar in size to the human brain clusterin, as discerned for the intact and cleaved clusterin under reducing conditions (D) or as the heterodimeric clusterin under non-reducing conditions (E).doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0033923.g004 To evaluate whether the clusterin proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 in vitro are similar to those produced in vivo, we compared ectopic clusterin with endogenous clusterin in SH-SY5Y cells and in human brain by Western blotting with a clusterin antibody. Endogenous clusterin in SH-SY5Y cells migrates at a slightly lower molecular weight than that resulting from CLU transfection, reflecting the 5.1 kDa V5/His tag encoded by the pcDNA3.1 vector expressing transfected CLU (Figure 4D). Importantly, this 5.1 kDa size difference between endogenous and transfected clusterin is similar to the size difference between the CLU1 and CLU2-predicted proteins, indicating that if the proteins encoded by CLU1 and CLU2 differed by 5 kDa, the proteins would be resolved easily under these experimental conditions. The endogenous SH-SY5Y clusterin migrates similarly to the intact protein detected in brain homogenates suggesting these cellular forms are similar to those present in vivo (Figure 4D). To extend this analysis to the heterodimeric form of clusterin, we also performed electrophoresis under non-reducing conditions. We found that heterodimeric protein from CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells appeared similar in size to each other and to the forms found in brain (Figure 4E). Hence, CLU1 and CLU2 produce proteins in vitro that are similar in size to endogenous clusterin in vitro and human brain.Discussion Top The main findings of this report are several. First, CLU1 and CLU2 are the primary CLU isoforms in human brain and differ in their first exon and proximal promoter. Second, the expression of only CLU1 was associated with rs11136000 while both CLU1 and CLU2 were increased with robust AD neuropathology. Third, CLU1 and CLU2 produce secreted clusterin proteins that are similar to each other and to clusterin in human brain. Since CLU is increased in AD and CLU1 is increased with the minor rs11136000T allele, which is also associated with reduced AD risk, we interpret our results as suggesting that increased CLU expression throughout life may reduce AD risk. Overall, these results identify a possible means underlying the association of rs11136000 with AD risk.The association between CLU expression and rs11136000 was discerned because the CLU isoforms were analyzed separately. For example, when we analyzed total CLU expression in the same fashion as reported here, total CLU was not associated with rs11136000 (p = 0.51) although a robust association with AD pathology was observed (p = 0.005, Ling et al., unpublished observations). The lack of a significant association between rs11136000 and total CLU is somewhat disconcerting since CLU1 and CLU2 appear to produce a similar protein. We speculate that (i) the threshold for clusterin biological significance may be less than the threshold for overall CLU statistical significance and/or (ii) CLU1 may be enriched in a cell type different than CLU2, which may affect its functionality. We note that the lack of an association between total CLU and rs11136000 was similar to prior reports that total CLU mRNA or clusterin protein were not associated with rs11136000 [17], [34]. As the clusterin produced by CLU1 and CLU2 appears similar, discerning an association between rs11136000 and clusterin would be especially challenging in tissues with a large proportion of CLU2. In this regard, CLU2 was the major isoform in choroid plexus, suggesting that an association between cerebrospinal fluid clusterin and rs11136000 would be difficult to detect. The differential regulation of CLU1 and CLU2 was not unexpected because CLU1 and CLU2 have separate proximal promoter regions. Consistent with this observation, Cochrane et al found that androgen-treatment in a prostate cancer cell line decreased CLU1 expression while enhancing CLU2 expression [35]. Although the identification of the functional SNPs and transcription factors that modulate CLU expression is beyond the scope of this report, we note that rs11136000 resides within intron 3 and is common to both CLU1 and CLU2. Hence, rs11136000 is likely not functional but rather is in linkage with a functional SNP more proximal to the CLU1 promoter. In summary, the association between rs11136000 and CLU1 was dependent upon analyzing the two CLU isoforms separately.Since earlier predictions were that CLU2 encodes a secreted protein while the additional 52 amino-terminal residues encoded by CLU1 would result in its intracellular localization [20], we expected clusterin in CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells to differ in cellular locale and size. In support of this prediction, the ATG translation initiation sites in the CLU1-specific exon 1a as well as the common exon 2 both satisfy Kozak consensus sequence requirements (http://bioinfo.iitk.ac.in/AUGPred/). However, clusterin in CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells was localized to the secretory pathway and was equivalent in size under conditions that would easily discern their predicted five kDa size difference, especially after PNGase F treatment to remove sugar residues. Hence, CLU1 and CLU2 produce similar secreted proteins in vitro. Comparable results were obtained in two cell types, suggesting that CLU1 and CLU2 generally produce soluble clusterin protein. The most parsimonious interpretation of these data is that CLU1 translation is generally initiated at the common exon 2 ATG. The possibility exists that a portion of CLU1 translation is initiated at the exon 1a ATG at levels too low to be readily detected or that produce an unstable protein which is rapidly degraded. Distinguishing among these possibilities is a future direction for this work. Overall, we summarize our current results by noting that the proteins produced from CLU1 and CLU2 in vitro are similar to each other, and similar in size to those present in human brain, leading us to interpret our data as supporting the possibility that CLU1 and CLU2 generally produce secreted clusterin protein in vitro and in vivo.A logical extension of the finding that AD risk is reduced with a genetic variant that correlates with increased CLU expression is that other factors that increase CLU expression may also reduce AD risk. Furthermore, since CLU expression is increased in AD without reversing the disease, we speculate that enhanced CLU expression reduces AD risk only if CLU expression is increased well before AD onset, mimicking the likely SNP effects. One possible modulator of interest is age-dependent changes in sex hormones since CLU isoforms are differentially regulated by androgens [35]. Stress has also been shown to upregulate CLU in many instances [36] and may cause the AD-associated increase in CLU observed here. In terms of possible therapeutic agents, multiple histone deacetylase inhibitors increase CLU expression robustly in vitro [37]. Interestingly, one member of this class, valproate, increases CLU expression in human astrocytes [37] and reduces amyloid accumulation as well as behavioral deficits in mouse amyloid models [38], [39]. While valproate may also act via other mechanisms [38], the actions of valproate on CLU expression may be relevant to its neuroprotection and merit further exploration to reduce AD risk.Limitations of this study include that rs11136000 and AD neuropathological status capture only ~20% of the variance in CLU expression. Identifying the unknown factors that account for the additional variance, which could include epigenetic factors, will facilitate understanding of CLU expression. Moreover, variability in these factors could facilitate or obscure the SNP association with CLU1 expression described here, suggesting that replication of these data in additional samples is necessary for their acceptance by the research community. Additionally, since the nuclear form of clusterin arising from an isoform lacking exon 2 has been associated with apoptosis [21], [22], this isoform may be transiently expressed and hence below our limits of detection, especially in comparison with CLU1 and CLU2.In conclusion, the AD-protective allele of rs11136000 was associated with increased expression of CLU1 but not CLU2 in our dataset. Both CLU1 and CLU2 produce a soluble, secreted clusterin protein that is similar to that observed in human brain. Discerning the association between rs11136000 and CLU1 depended upon analyzing these two CLU isoforms separately.Acknowledgments Top The authors gratefully acknowledge tissue supplied by the University of Kentucky AD Center and Ishita Parikh for technical assistance.Author Contributions Top Conceived and designed the experiments: IL SE.

PLoS ONE: Somatostatin Modulates Insulin-Degrading-Enzyme Metabolism: Implications for the Regulation of Microglia Activity in ADOpen AccessResearch ArticleSomatostatin Modulates Insulin-Degrading-Enzyme Metabolism: Implications for the Regulation of Microglia Activity in ADGrazia Tundo1, Chiara Ciaccio1, Diego Sbardella1,2, Mariaserena Boraso3, Barbara Viviani3, Massimiliano Coletta1,2, Stefano Marini1*1 Department of Experimental Medicine and Biochemical Sciences, University of Roma Tor Vergata, Roma, Italy, 2 Interuniversity Consortium for the Research on the Chemistry of Metals in Biological Systems, Bari, Italy, 3 Department of Pharmacological Sciences, University of Milan, Milan, ItalyAbstract Top The deposition of β-amyloid (Aβ) into senile plaques and the impairment of somatostatin-mediated neurotransmission are key pathological events in the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Insulin-degrading-enzyme (IDE) is one of the main extracellular protease targeting Aβ, and thus it represents an interesting pharmacological target for AD therapy. We show that the active form of somatostatin-14 regulates IDE activity by affecting its expression and secretion in microglia cells. A similar effect can also be observed when adding octreotide. Following a previous observation where somatostatin directly interacts with IDE, here we demonstrate that somatostatin regulates Aβ catabolism by modulating IDE proteolytic activity in IDE gene-silencing experiments. As a whole, these data indicate the relevant role played by somatostatin and, potentially, by analogue octreotide, in preventing Aβ accumulation by partially restoring IDE activity.Citation: Tundo G, Ciaccio C, Sbardella D, Boraso M, Viviani B, et al.

Although molecular basis of AD remains largely unclear, there is considerable evidence which supports the so-called “amyloid cascade hypothesis”: AD may be viewed as a metabolic vicious cycle in which β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition into senile plaques drives neurodegeneration by triggering abnormal microglia activation, tau protein hyperphosphorylation and the consequent death of astrocytes and neurons. Aβ accumulation in the brain is the result of the imbalance between its biosynthesis and removal [2], [3]. Several proteases, such as insulin-degrading-enzyme (IDE), neprilysin (NEP) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) are involved in Aβ degradation [4]–[6]. In this regard, a decrease in Aβ-degrading enzymes expression or activity, as a result of genetic factors, age and environmental conditions, may be a crucial aspect in AD pathogenesis [7]. Notably, IDE is a zinc metalloendopeptidase that hydrolyzes a wide range of substrates, including insulin, amylin, glucagon, atrial natriuretic factor and insulin-like growth factors I and II [8]. Even though its role in the onset of AD is not yet to be completely understood [5], the relevance of IDE in AD pathogenesis has been validated in works which have mapped the IDE gene on chromosome 10 [9], [10], making it a candidate gene for the AD-6 locus. Furthermore, it has been shown that, during aging, IDE decreases in the brain of AD patients [11]–[13]. Additionally, several studies underline a link between IDE haplotypes and SNPs in the IDE gene, associating them to AD [14]–[16]. We have recently demonstrated that somatostatin (sst) is a substrate and an allosteric modulator of IDE activity, which enhances the proteolytic processing of a synthetic Aβ-peptide [17]. Somatostatin depletion in the cortex and hippocampus of AD patients is directly connected to memory and learning impairment [18]–[20] and a strong reduction of sst-expressing neurons in the mouse CA1 hippocampal region seems to be associated to the onset of AD [21]. Somatostatin seems to be also involved in the regulation of neprilysin activity by affecting its expression and its synaptic localization [22]. Although molecular mechanisms coupling somatostatin depletion and AD remain unclear, somatostatin transmitter replacement has been identified as a potential pharmacological strategy for AD prevention [23], [24]. Furthermore, the activation of somatostatin neurotransmission by sst-releasing agents, such as FK960 and FK962, has been shown to significantly improve cognitive performances in animal models [25], [26]. On the other hand, although in the past, the use of the somatostatin analogue octreotide in clinical trials has not been unequivocally associated to the restoration of cognitive functions, there is some evidence which seems to demonstrate its potential therapeutic value [24], [27]. Since microglia secretes Aβ and IDE [28], [29] and displays three functionally active receptor subtypes for somatostatin (sst) (i.e. Receptors type 2, 3 and 4) [30], [31], we investigated sst effect on IDE expression in microglia cells. In this work, we show that in activated microglia, somatostatin regulates IDE expression, secretion and proteolytic activity toward Aβ, which suggests that somatostatin pathological depletion could be one of the key events leading to Aβ deposition.Materials and Methods Top MaterialsMouse BV-2 microglial cells were kindly provided by Prof. D. Rosato (University of Perugia, Italy) and N9 cells by Prof. R. Ciccarelli (University of Chieti, Italy) [32], [33]. Octreotide was a generous gift from Italfarmaco. RPMI 1640, fetal bovine serum, L-glutammine, penicillin, streptomycin, sodium pyruvate and ciprofloxacin were purchased from Euro Clone (Life Sciences Division, Italy). Minimum essential Eagle's medium, fetal calf serum, trypsin 2.5%, DNAse 1%, glucose, streptomycin, penicillin, L-glutammine, L-leucine methyl ester were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Human somatostatin was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA); recombinant insulin degrading-enzyme was purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA, USA); β-amyloid (1–40) was obtained from Anaspec (San Jose, CA, USA). An IDE siRNA SmartPool and a non-specific control pool were synthesized by Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO, USA). Each pool contains four individual siRNA duplex sequences. Lipofectamine and OptiMEM medium were obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA). A β-amyloid(1–40) Elisa kit was obtained from IBL-Humburg (Hamburg, Germany); an RNasy Plus micro kit for RNA isolation was obtained from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany) and a Masterscript kit and SYBER ROX Master Mix came from 5PRIME (Humburg, Germany). All other chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich.Methods Top Cell culture. BV-2, a murine microglial cell line, was cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS), L-glutammine (2 mM), penicillin (50 IU/ml), streptomycin (50 µg/ml), sodium pyruvate (1 mM) and ciprofloxacin (0.03 mM). Cells were seeded on 96-well plates (1×104/well) and grown overnight at 37°C in 5% CO2[32].Astrocytes and microglia cell cultures. Primary cultures of glial cells were prepared from 2-day-old newborn rats (Sprague–Dawley, Charles River, Calco, Italy). Cerebral hemispheres were freed of the meninges and were mechanically disrupted. Cells were dissociated in a solution of trypsin 2.5% and DNAse 1%, filtered through a 100-µm nylon mesh, and plated in a 75 cm2 flask (5×106/flask) in minimum essential Eagle's medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, glucose (0.6%), streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml), penicillin (100 IU/ml) and L-glutammine (2 mM). Glial cultures were fed twice a week and grown at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. A layer of astrocytic cells was obtained through the vigorous shaking of a confluent 10-day-old monolayer of mixed glial cells [34]. Cultures of enriched astroglia were treated further with 5 mM L-leucine methyl ester to eliminate microglia (97% homogeneity). Isolated astroglial preparations were then seeded in 96-well plates (6×104/well) in MEM with supplements as above. Microglia were isolated by shaking glial cultures at 260 rpm for 2 hrs. Microglia which dislodged into the medium were purified by plating for 30 min in 96-well plates (6×104/well). Contaminating cells were removed with supernatant. These conditions allowed us to obtain highly enriched microglial cultures with 98% homogeneity, as assessed by immunocytochemistry with Griffonia simplicifolia isolectin B4.All animal protocols have been performed to Department of Pharmacological Sciences, University of Milan. The experiments were designed so as to minimize the number of animals used. Animal protocols for these studies have been approved for Department of Pharmacological Sciences by the Ministry of Health and were conducted with minimal suffering of the animals and strictly following European Community (ECC Directive no. 609/86) and local (Italian legislative Decree no. 116, January 27, 1992) regulations for animal care. All animal care procedures were in accordance with the local Animal Care Committee, and no weight loss or death was observed after we had received them in our animal facility.Treatment and sample preparation. Indicated concentrations of somatostatin (dissolved in 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7.3) were added to the cell culture medium on the day after plating. Stimulation was carried out overnight at 37°C in 5% CO2. Supernatants of stimulated and nonstimulated cells were collected and frozen at −20°C until use, while the monolayers were lysed in a solubilization buffer containing 50 mM NaCl, 1% Triton, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride in the presence of a protease inhibitor cocktail with broad specificity for the inhibtion of serine, cysteine, aspartic and aminopeptidases (from Sigma-Aldrich).Qualitative Insulin-degrading-enzyme analysis by Western Blotting. Total protein concentration of cell lysates was determined by a Bradford assay [35]. 10 µg of each sample were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred on Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose filters (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) for 1 h at 4°C. Membranes were blocked in a PBS Tween (T-PBS) 0.01%, 5% fat-free milk solution, then probed with IDE rabbit polyclonal antibody BC2 (Covance, Princeton, NJ, USA, 1:3000 in T-PBS-0.1% and incubated with an Horse Radish Peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Biorad, Hercules, CA, USA, 1:50000 in T-PBS 0.2% fatty free milk). Immunoreactive signals were detected with an ECL Advance Western Blotting Detection Kit (Amersham Biosciences). Densitometric analysis was performed by Image Quant TL program.Secreted IDE quantification in BV-2 cell supernatants by ELISA. IDE goat polyclonal antibody K-20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) was diluted in PBS 1× and coated on a microtiter plate at a final concentration of 0.5 µg/ml. Unsaturated binding sites were blocked in T-PBS-0.01% 5% fat-free milk solution before exposure to BV-2 cell supernatants. An IDE rabbit polyclonal antibody BC2 (1:3000in T-PBS 0.01%) and a Horse Radish Peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:50000 in T-PBS 0.2% fat-free milk) were used for IDE quantification. IDE concentration was determined by using a TMB colorimetric kit according to product instructions. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm in a microtiter plate reader (Tecan, Switzerland). A standard curve was performed by using known concentrations of recombinant IDE (Calbiochem).Quantitative real-time PCR. The total RNA from each sample of BV-2 cells was isolated using an RNeasy Plus micro kit for RNA isolation according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA of total RNA was generated in two reaction volumes of Masterscript kit using random hexamers. Real-time PCR was performed by SDS7700 (Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA, USA) with Manual SYBER ROX Master Mix. GAPDH was measured as the internal control. Primer sequences were: ACGAGGCTATACGTCCAAGATTG and ATTGCCACCCGCACATTTT (Forward and Reverse, respectively) for IDE; AACTTTGGCATTGTGGAAGG and CACATTGGGGGTAGGAACAC (Forward and Reverse, respectively) for GAPDH. The following cycles were performed: initial denaturation cycle at 95°C for 2 min, followed by 40 amplification cycles at 95°C for 15 s, at 58°C for 30 s and at 68°C for 30 s.Analysis of MMP-9 in Zymography and Western Blotting. Aliquots of supernatants from cell culture samples were run under non-reducing denaturant conditions on 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 1 mg/mL gelatine (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), soaked twice in 2.5% Triton X-100 for 20 min and then incubated for 18 hrs in the developing buffer (20 mM Tris, 5 mM CaCl2, pH 7.4). For visualization purposes, the gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 and destained with 10% acetic acid and 20% methanol solution. For the Western blotting analysis of MMP-9 in cell lysates, 10 µg of whole cell lysate were separated on 10% polyacrylamide gel and then transferred onto a Hybond nitrocellulose membrane. Non-specific sites were blocked with a 0.025% T-PBS 5% fat-free milk solution and filters were then probed with a polyclonal anti-MMP-9 antibody (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, CO 1:2000 in 0.1% T-PBS) and thereafter with a Horse Radish Peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody, (1:50000 in T-PBS 0.2% fat-free milk). Immunoreactive signals were detected with an ECL Advance Western Blotting Detection Kit (Amersham Biosciences).IDE siRNA Transfection. BV-2 cells were used for transfection when 30%–40% confluent in order to obtain the greatest transfection efficiency. Cells were transfected with 20 pmol of IDE-siRNA or siRNA control pool using Lipofectamine in OptiMEM media according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Somatostatin stimulation was performed 48 h after transfection.ß-amyloid(1–40) quantification in BV-2 conditioned medium with sandwich ELISA. Human somatostatin was added at different concentrations to the culture medium of control and IDE-siRNA transfected BV-2 cells. According to the manufacturer's instructions, the incubation was carried out for 1 h at 37°C and the supernatants collected for β-amyloid(1–40) quantification by ELISA. Equal volumes of each sample were incubated overnight at 4°C on plates pre-coated with anti-Aβ (35–40) Mouse IgG. HRP conjugated anti-mouse Aβ(1–16) rabbit IgG was incubated at 4°C for 1 h. Reactivity was developed with TMB for 30 min at room temperature and stopped with 1 N H2SO4. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm with a microtiter plate reader. A standard curve was obtained with Aβ(1–40).Statistical analysis. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine significant differences among groups. Tukey's honestly significant difference post hoc test was used for pair wise comparisons after the analysis of variance.Results Top Somatostatin modulation of IDE expressionBV-2 cells as well as primary rat microglia were stimulated with different sst concentrations and the IDE level was analyzed by Western blotting in cell lysates collected after 24 hrs of incubation. As shown in Figure 1, sst increases IDE expression in primary (A) and BV-2 cells (B). Since sst half life in the serum is short [36], the same sst concentration was re-added 6 hrs after the first administration. This addition further amplifies the positive modulation of IDE expression (Figure 1). It is interesting to note that WB analysis on cell lysates of sst-stimulated N9 microglia cell line confirms the enhancing effect on IDE expression (data not shown). In order to assess whether the effect of sst on IDE expression is a microglia characteristic, rat astrocytes which display three sst receptor subtypes as well (SSTR-1, SSTR-2, and SSTR-4) [37] were incubated with the same somatostatin concentrations (Figure S1). IDE level was analyzed by Western blotting in cell lysates collected after 24 hrs of sst incubation and as indicated in Figure S1, no detectable modulation of IDE expression was observed.thumbnailFigure 1. Somatostatin induces an increase of IDE expression in microglia cells.Western blot analysis of normalized lysis samples from rat primary microglia (A) and BV-2 (B) indicates that IDE level increases after 24 hrs of somatostatin incubation, while the internal control ß-tubulin is constant. The additional incubation with sst after 6 hrs from first round strengthens the effect on IDE expression (left panel). Densitometric analysis of IDE WB signals, average ± ES of 5 independent experiments in triplicate (right panel). *P&lt;0.05, one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey's test, n = 15.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0034376.g001 Since there was no principle difference in the response to somatostatin in microglia cell lines compared to primary rat microglia, immortalized BV-2 cells were subsequently used. The sst-mediated up-regulation of IDE in BV-2 cells was further checked by quantifying the mRNA using a RealTime-PCR. A time-course investigation reveals that IDE mRNA increases linearly with the sst concentration within 5 hrs to incubation and turns back after 24 hrs, suggesting a transcriptional effect triggered by sst in BV2 cells (Figure 2A).thumbnailFigure 2. Somatostatin modulation on IDE level in BV-2 cells.(A) IDE mRNA increases after 5 hrs of incubation with somatostatin (white columns); 24 hrs after incubation, the level is similar to the control (grey columns). Basal mRNA levels were measured by real time PCR in individual preparations of BV2. Data were first normalized against GAPDH and then expressed setting the value measured in controls at 1. The results presented are the means ± ES (B) Elisa analysis of conditioned medium indicates that IDE level increases in BV-2 cells after 24 hrs of incubation as a function of somatostatin concentration. The results presented are the means ± SEs of five independent experiments in triplicate. P&lt;0.05, one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey's test, n = 15.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0034376.g002 Somatostatin effect on IDE secretionIt is known that a small fraction of IDE (ranging from 3% to 10%) is secreted into the extracellular space, where it presumably interacts with its substrates, such as insulin and β-amyloid [8], [38]. In order to determine whether, besides inducing synthesis, sst also stimulates IDE secretion, the enzyme concentration in cell supernatants was quantified 24 hrs after sst administration. As reported in Figure 2B, the neuropeptide induces the increase of IDE secretion in a similar way to WB and RT-PCR (Figue 1B and 2A). This result indicates that somatostatin acts not only by modulating IDE expression, but also by affecting IDE secretion and increasing the amount of the enzyme in the extracellular space.Somatostatin effect on MMP-9 activityIn addition to their ability to phagocyte β-amyloid, microglia can also clear Aβ by degradation through the production of Aβ-degrading enzymes, such as IDE, neprilysin and MMP-9 [29], [33], [39]. Therefore, we assessed whether sst is involved in the regulation of MMP-9 level. For this purpose, BV-2 cells were stimulated with different sst concentrations and MMP-9 activity was measured by zymographyc analysis (Figure 3A). No detectable modulation of MMP-9 gelatinolytic activity was observed for each experimental condition. Qualitative analysis of MMP-9 content was further performed on total cell lysates. A polyclonal anti-MMP-9 antibody recognizes a single band around 92 kDa, corresponding to the pro-MMP-9, which is constant over the different sst concentrations (Figure 3B). This result rules out any involvement of sst in the modulation of MMP-9 expression, secretion and activity.thumbnailFigure 3. Effect of somatostatin on MMP-9 expression.(A) Zymographyc analysis of cell culture supernatants harvested after 24 hrs of incubation indicate that somatostain administration does not modulate gelatinolytic activity of MMP-9 in each of the experimental conditions. (B) In Western blotting analysis of cell lysates a polyclonal anti-MMP-9 antibody recognizes a single band corresponding to the pro-MMP-9 (92 kDa) which is not modulated over each experimental condition. Analysis of β-tubulin represents the internal control. The results presented are the means ± ES of three indipendent experiments in triplicate, n = 9.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0034376.g003 Octreotide modulation of IDE expressionRecently, somatostatin transmitter replacement has been viewed as a potential AD therapeutical strategy [24], [40]. In this regard, BV-2 cells were stimulated with octreotide, a long-acting octapeptide somatostatin analogue commonly used in clinical trials, in order to verify the effect on the expression pattern of IDE [41]. 0.1–10 µM octreotide induces a dose-dependent increase of IDE expression (Figure 4A) in a similar way to what can be observed in the presence of somatostatin (Figure 1). A similar result can also be obtained for IDE secretion, by using an ELISA assay on BV-2 cell supernatants collected 24 hrs after the administration (Figure 4B). Therefore, these findings indicate that octreotide and sst exert a very similar effect on IDE expression and secretion in BV-2 cells (see Figures 1, 2 and 4).thumbnailFigure 4. Somatostatin analogue octreotide increases IDE expression and secretion.(A) WB (left panel) and densitometric analysis of IDE (right panel) after 24 hrs incubation with the indicated concentrations of octreotide. (B) ELISA analysis on BV-2 medium after octreotide incubation reveals that the sst analogue induces IDE secretion. In every case, the results presented are the means ± ES of four independent experiments in triplicate. * P&lt;0.05, oneway ANOVA, followed by Tukey's test, n = 12.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0034376.g004 Somatostatin regulation of Aβ(1–40) degradation by insulin-degrading-enzymeWe have previously shown that somatostatin is an IDE substrate and an allosteric modulator of recombinant IDE enzymatic activity toward a fluorogenic β-peptide [17]. Therefore, we aimed to verify whether sst by allosteric modulation of endogenous IDE could affect the clearance of the Aβ peptide secreted by BV-2 cells. To this purpose, IDE expression was silenced through a siRNA-based approach. At the maximum rate of IDE silencing (corresponding to about 60%–70%, see Figure 5A), different somatostatin concentrations (ranging between 0.01 µM and 0.5 µM) were added to the culture medium of both silenced and non-silenced cells. Aβ(1–40) was quantified in cell supernatants after 1 h of somatostatin stimulation, a time interval during which there was no accumulation of newly synthesized IDE, a fact that was demonstrated through Western Blotting analysis on cell lysates (data not shown). Aβ(1–40) concentration was slightly reduced at sst 0.01 µM in both silenced and not-silenced cells. In spite of this, Aβ(1–40) concentration was not further altered in the medium of silenced cells by increasing sst concentrations, while it was progressively reduced in the medium of non-silenced cells (Figure 5B), suggesting that the reduction of Aβ observed at sst 0.01 in silenced cells could be due to the effect of sst on residual IDE. Therefore, at physiological concentrations, sst modulates IDE activity also by promoting Aβ(1–40) degradation in the BV-2 cells supernatants.thumbnailFigure 5. Somatostatin regulates IDE activity enhancing IDE-dependent Aβ degradation.(A) BV-2 cells transfected with a specific IDE siRNA pool show reduced levels of IDE protein, compared to cells transfected with a nonspecific control siRNA pool (right panel). (B) Aβ(1–40) quantification through sandwich ELISA reveals that the levels of Aβ are drastically reduced in the presence of IDE steady level (grey columns) compared to IDE-silencing samples (white columns). The results presented are the means ± ES of three independent experiments in triplicate.

In this regard, the extracellular Aβ degrading enzymes (such as IDE, MMP-9 and NEP) are now considered promising therapeutic targets for AD treatment [33]. Notably, IDE is the main extracellular protease secreted by microglia involved in Aβ degradation, even though the molecular basis of IDE regulation are poorly known [5]. Microglia seems to cover a two-fold role in AD pathogenesis. Firstly, early microglia activation exerts a neuroprotective effect by promoting Aβ clearance. Secondly, as the disease progresses, the microglia Aβ-clearing capability is compromised [38], [41]. This downregulation is followed by an increase of Aβ released by neurons and by a worsening of the disease [32]. We previously demonstrated that sst is an allosteric modulator of IDE [17]. In this work, we further study the effect of sst on IDE showing that the neuropeptide somatostatin also specifically regulates IDE, the main extracellular Aβ protease, by affecting its expression and secretion in both primary and BV-2 microglia cells. Somatostatin triggers IDE gene transcription and protein which displays a different turnover rate: IDE-mRNA reaches a maximum of transcription within 5 hrs after stimulation, returning to the basal level within 24 hrs, whereas the protein concentration increases in cell lysates and supernatants at later times, being still clearly evident after 24 hrs. Through this pathway, somatostatin enhances IDE secretion, strengthening the pool of active enzymes which interact with β-amyloid and other IDE extracellular substrates. This effect is specific for IDE since sst does not affect either secretion and activity of MMP-9, another enzyme which is active in Aβ degradation. It is known that IDE and somatostatin levels are altered in AD progression [3], [20]. It is thus conceivable that sst depletion results in a decrease of IDE expression and secretion contributing to the pathological deposition of β-amyloid in the brain. In addition, since the Aβ chronic accumulation triggers a further reduction in sst level [18], all these events could represent a vicious cycle which ultimately favors Aβ plaque formations. As matter of fact, somatostatinergic transmitter replacement is a potentially viable strategy in the treatment of AD, even though the pharmacological restoration of this deficit has not been unequivocally associated to a recovery of normal cognitive performances [24], [26], [40]. In this framework, we tested the octreotide effect on IDE expression, a somatostatin analogue currently used in the treatment of acromegaly, pituitary adenomes and pancreatic tumors [41], [42]. Here, we show that, like somatostatin, octreotide increases IDE expression and secretion, although the effects are generally reduced compared to the endogenous modulator. Somatostatin binds all five receptor subtypes with high affinity, whereas octreotide is a selective agonist, binding to receptor subtypes 2 and 5 with high affinity (but lower than somatostatin) and with moderate affinity to subtype 3 [41]. Therefore, this evidence might explain the discrepancy between sst and its analogue concerning the positive modulation of IDE expression, even though additional factors cannot be ruled out. Interestingly, we also observed that in astrocytes, incubation with somatostatin does not have any significant detectable effect of IDE expression, reinforcing the physiological relevance of somatostatin action on IDE secretion in microglia cells. This discrepancy is probably due to the different expression pattern of sst receptor on microglia (i.e. SSTR-2, SSTR-3, and SSTR-4) and astrocytes (i.e. SSTR-1, SSTR-2, and SSTR-4) [31], [35]. In our previous work, we reported that somatostatin is an allosteric modulator of IDE enzymatic activity on a fluorogenic Aβ-peptide [17]. Here, we show that somatostatin addition to the culture medium of BV-2 cells rapidly affects the amyloid β-peptide (1–40) extracellular concentration: after 1 h of stimulation (a time interval over which there is no accumulation of newly synthesized IDE), we observe a negative correlation between Aβ concentration and sst concentration. The lack of similar evidence in supernatants from IDE-silenced cells suggests that the decrease in Aβ levels is fully attributable to the modulation of IDE activity secreted before sst administration. As a whole, the reported data indicate that somatostatin regulates IDE expression, secretion and catalytic activity in microglia. These results are intriguing, considering that a microglia pharmacological manipulation is thought to play a neuroprotective role at least in the early stages of AD, since these cells cluster around senile plaques promoting Aβ phagocytosis and degradation [3], [40], [43]. Therefore, a correlation can be envisaged between the regulation of IDE activity and the microglial immunological function during the development of AD, opening a new therapeutic scenario for the control of AD in the early phases.Supporting Information Top Figure S1.

Particularly, mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of amyloid-beta-induced neuronal toxicity in Alzheimer’s disease. The recent emphasis on the intracellular biology of amyloid-beta and its precursor protein (APP) has led researchers to consider the possibility that mitochondria-associated and mitochondrial amyloid-beta may directly cause neurotoxicity. Both proteins are known to localize to mitochondrial membranes, block the transport of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins to mitochondria, interact with mitochondrial proteins, disrupt the electron transport chain, increase reactive oxygen species production, cause mitochondrial damage, and prevent neurons from functioning normally. In this paper, we will outline current knowledge of the intracellular localization of amyloid-beta. Moreover, we summarize evidence from AD postmortem brain as well as animal AD models showing that amyloid-beta triggers mitochondrial dysfunction through a number of pathways such as impairment of oxidative phosphorylation, elevation of reactive oxygen species production, alteration of mitochondrial dynamics, and interaction with mitochondrial proteins. Thus, this paper supports the Alzheimer cascade mitochondrial hypothesis such as the most important early events in this disease, and probably one of the future strategies on the therapy of this neurodegenerative disease. 1. IntroductionEach year, over 10 million people globally suffer from neurodegenerative diseases. This figure is expected to grow by 20% over the next decade as the aging population increases and lives longer. This disease group is the fourth biggest killer in the developed world after heart diseases, cancer, and stroke [1]. The most common neurodegenerative diseases are AD, Parkinson disease, Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [2]. The most widely recognized is AD, which is among the principal debilitating conditions of the current century. Approximately 24 million people worldwide suffer from dementia, 60% of cases being due to AD, which occurs in 1% of individuals aged 50 to 70 years old and dramatically increases to 50% of those over 70 years old [3]. Dramatically, these numbers are estimated to increase to 15 million in the next 40 years [4].From the neuropathological point of view, AD is characterized by selective neuronal loss, marked synaptic alteration, morphological mitochondrial abnormalities, and Tau pathology. The histological hallmark lesions of AD are characterized by senile plaques and cerebrovascular deposits. The extracellular amyloid plaques mainly composed of amyloid-beta and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles built up of hyperphosphorylated tau, although the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease are still unknown and there is still no cure. Many lines of evidence suggest that oxidative stress is one of the earliest changes and plays an important role in the pathological process in AD, and more recently, energy deficiency and mitochondrial dysfunction have been recognized as a prominent, early event in AD [1–11]. Oxidative stress plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of AD and is intimately linked to aging, the best established risk factor for AD. Increased oxidative stress levels have been found in the brains of patients with AD in Sweden and early in Tg2576 APP transgenic mice [12, 13]. Recently, we described that PLA2G3 gene silencing produced a marked inhibition of the free radical-generating xanthine/xanthine oxidase- (X-XOD-) system-induced cell death, and that PLA2G3 polymorphisms are associated with AD in a Spanish case-control sample [14]. In previous studies with choroid plexus homogenates with different cases with AD in the different stages (I/0, III-IV, and V-VI), we demonstrated that in AD patients, amyloid-beta peptide also accumulates in choroid plexus [15], there is an oxidation of carboxymethyl-lysine (CML), and N-carboxyethyl-lysine (CEL) may result in impaired protein interactions, protein folding, and protein kinase activity; abnormal function of endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells; impaired HDL-cholesterol metabolism in the choroid plexus in advanced stages of AD [16].2. MitochondriaMitochondria are found in virtually all eukaryotic cells and function to generate cellular energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by oxidative phosphorylation and are thought to be derived evolutionarily from the fusion of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms [17]. They are also involved in regulation of cell death via apoptosis, in the control of cell division and growth, in calcium homeostasis, haem biosynthesis, and in the formation and export of iron-sulphur clusters.Mitochondria are composed of a double lipid membrane which structures four compartments, distinct by composition and function (Figure 1). The porous outer membrane encompasses the whole organelle. It contains many proteins like import complexes and voltage-dependent anion channels responsible for the free passage of low-molecular-weight substances (up to 5000 Da) between the cytoplasm and the intermembrane space which represents a reservoir of protons establishing a proton electrochemical gradient across inner mitochondrial membrane that is needed for the production of ATP via ATPase (complex V). Intermembrane space contains proapoptotic proteins like cytochrome c, Smac/Diablo, EndoG, and Htra2/Omi. In contrast to the permeable outer membrane, the inner mitochondrial membrane, rich in cardiolipin, provides a highly efficient barrier to the flow of small molecules and ions, including protons. This membrane is invaginated into numerous cristae increasing cell surface area. It houses the respiratory enzymes of the electron transport chain, the cofactor coenzyme Q, and many mitochondrial carriers. In the matrix, different metabolic pathways take place including the tricarboxylic or Krebs cycle [18].324968.fig.001Figure 1: Representative electromicrographs of mitochondrial ultrastructure. Scale bar 200 nm.Mitochondria are unique amongst cellular organelles in that they have their own, circular, double-stranded DNA (mtDNA) which is inherited almost exclusively down the maternal line and codes for 37 mitochondrial genes, 13 of which translate to proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation [18, 19]. The remaining genes encode transfer (22 genes) and ribosomal (2 genes) RNA allowing the mitochondria to generate their own proteins. Although mitochondria have the ability to produce proteins, the vast majority of proteins that function within the mitochondria, including those involved in DNA transcription, translation, and repair, are encoded by nuclear DNA and are transported into the mitochondria from the cytosol. As mtDNA is located in the mitochondria in close proximity to the electron transport chain, it is more susceptible to damage from free radicals generated during oxidative phosphorylation [20].Mitochondria generate energy by two closely coordinated metabolic processes: Krebs cycle and the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). OXPHOS is made up of the electron transport chain assembled in four enzymes (complex I to IV) as well as the F1F0-ATP synthase (complex V). Complexes I, III, and IV are located in inner mitochondrial membrane as integral proteins, whereas complex II is attached to the inner surface of this membrane. The function of the chain is to generate cellular energy in the form of ATP. These five enzymes of the complex are connected functionally by mobile electron acceptors and donors: ubiquinone and cytochrome c. Electrons from NADH and FADH2 are fed into complexes I and II, respectively. Ubiquinone Q carries electrons from both complexes to complex II, and cytochrome c does it from complex III to IV reducing molecular oxygen to water. As electrons are transferred along electron transport chain, a fixed number of protons are pumped from the matrix into inner membrane space establishing a electrochemical gradient characterized with a specific electrical potential. The redox energy drives the synthesis of ATP from ADP as protons are transported back from inner membrane space into the matrix via complex V.3. Amyloid-Beta in the CytosolAccumulation of amyloid-beta in AD brains is thought to underlie neuronal dysfunction and memory loss, being centrally implicated in AD pathogenesis. Moreover, previous to mitochondrial accumulation of amyloid-beta showed in AD patient and AD transgenic mouse brain, the toxic amyloid-beta species has to be accumulated in the cytosol of the cells. Many studies showed amyloid-beta interaction with different receptors in the cellular membrane of the vasculature, neurons, oligodendrocytes, and glial cells where it is transported from cell surface into endosomal and lysosomal compartments [21–23]. The aberrant signalling of these receptors in AD triggered an abnormal accumulation of amyloid-beta into cytosol-inducing cellular stress underlies to neuronal dysfunction and dementia.It is described by our group and others that these receptors can be megalin, also known as low-density lipoprotein-related protein-2 (LRP2) [24], LRP-1 [22], or RAGE (receptors for advanced glycation end products) [25]. The interaction of these receptors with amyloid-beta in neurons, microglia, and vascular cells accelerates and amplifies deleterious effects on neuronal and synaptic functions. These findings are further in line with the recently proposed hypothesis of an intracellular amyloid-beta toxicity cascade which suggests that the toxic amyloid-beta species intervening in molecular and biochemical abnormalities may be intracellular soluble aggregates instead of extracellular, insoluble plaques. There are many studies proposing that megalin- and/or RAGE-dependent signalling are involved in the regulation of amyloid-beta clearance and probably may contribute to amyloid pathology and cognitive dysfunction observed in the AD patients and AD mouse model.4. Amyloid-Beta and MitochondriaStudies of postmortem brains from AD patients and transgenic mouse models of AD suggest that oxidative damage, induced by amyloid-beta, is associated with mitochondria early in AD progression. Amyloid-beta and APP protein are known to localize to mitochondrial membranes, block the transport of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins to mitochondria, interact with mitochondrial proteins, disrupt the electron transport chain, increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, cause mitochondrial damage, and prevent neurons from functioning normally. Recent scientific research has identified multiple mechanisms of amyloid-beta interaction with mitochondria at different mitochondrial compartments: the outer mitochondrial membrane, intermembrane space, inner mitochondrial membrane, and the matrix. It is well known that the involvement of amyloid-beta-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in AD pathogenesis, a vicious cycle as well as several vicious circles within the cycle, each accelerating the other, can be drawn emphasizing the Alzheimer mitochondrial cascade hypothesis.The brain is vulnerable to oxidative stress owing to its high lipid content, its relatively high oxygen metabolism, and its low levels of antioxidant defenses [26]. One of the most interesting events in AD is that mitochondrial oxidative stress occurs early in AD progression, before the onset of amyloid-beta pathology [27, 28]. Oxidative stress was also reported in the mitochondria of other tissues different to the brain such as platelets and fibroblasts from AD patients [29, 30].Free radicals (compounds with an unpaired electron) or ROS are a normal part of metabolism. Mitochondria are the major source of ROS, and, in fact, mitochondrial dysfunction as well as hypometabolism has long been implicated in the onset of the familial and sporadic forms of AD [31]. mtDNA defects have also been linked to an increased incidence of AD [32]. Quantitative morphometric, molecular, and cellular analysis of mitochondria shows increased abnormal and damaged mitochondria in AD [33, 34]. Energy deficiency and mitochondrial dysfunction have been recognized as a prominent, early event in AD.Mitochondrial abnormalities have been found both in neurons and astrocytes [35–37], suggesting that both neurons and astrocytes might be damaged by free radicals in the AD brain. Superoxide radicals might be produced in mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes I and III [38] and in components of the Krebs cycle, including a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase [39]. In addition, superoxide radicals might be generated in the outer mitochondrial membrane. H2O2 and superoxide radicals, released from the mitochondrial matrix and from the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes, might be carried to the cytoplasm and, ultimately, might lead to the oxidation of cytoplasmic proteins [26].Several lines of evidence suggest that APP and amyloid-beta are factors contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction in AD (Figure 2). Mitochondria were found to be the target both for amyloid precursor protein (APP) that accumulates in the mitochondrial import channels and for amyloid-beta that interacts with several proteins inside mitochondria and leads to mitochondrial dysfunction [30]. Multiple lines of evidence support APP and amyloid-beta as contributing factors to mitochondrial dysfunction in AD: both APP and amyloid-beta are present in mitochondrial membrane and interact with mitochondrial proteins, block mitochondrial import channels, impair mitochondrial transport, disrupt the electron transfer chain, increase ROS levels, and cause mitochondrial damage.324968.fig.002Figure 2: APP processing in nondemented healthy individuals and AD patients. APP processing occurs by two pathways: a beta-secretase-based amyloidogenic and alpha-secretase-based nonamyloidogenic pathway. In the nonamyloidogenic pathway (left), cleavage occurs by alpha-secretase within the amyloid-beta domain and generates the large soluble N-terminal fragment (sAPPα) and a non-amyloidogenic C-terminal fragment of 83 amino acid residues (C83). Further cleavage of this C-terminal fragment by γ-secretase generates the nonamyloidogenic peptide (P3) and APP intracellular domain (ACID). These products are nontoxic. The non-amyloidogenic α-secretase pathway occurs in over 90% of humans, and these individuals generally do not develop dementia. In the amyloidogenic pathway (right), cleavage occurs by β-secretase at the beginning of the amyloid-beta domain and generates a soluble N-terminus fragment (sAPPβ) and amyloidogenic C-terminal fragment of 99 residues (C99). This C-terminal fragment is further cleaved by

PLoS ONE: Alzheimer's Disease-Linked Mutations in Presenilin-1 Result in a Drastic Loss of Activity in Purified γ-Secretase ComplexesOpen AccessResearch ArticleAlzheimer's Disease-Linked Mutations in Presenilin-1 Result in a Drastic Loss of Activity in Purified γ-Secretase ComplexesMatthias Cacquevel, Lorène Aeschbach, Jemila Houacine, Patrick C. Fraering*École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Brain Mind Institute, Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Biology of Alzheimer's Disease, Lausanne, SwitzerlandAbstract Top BackgroundMutations linked to early onset, familial forms of Alzheimer's disease (FAD) are found most frequently in PSEN1, the gene encoding presenilin-1 (PS1). Together with nicastrin (NCT), anterior pharynx-defective protein 1 (APH1), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2), the catalytic subunit PS1 constitutes the core of the γ-secretase complex and contributes to the proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) into amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides. Although there is a growing consensus that FAD-linked PS1 mutations affect Aβ production by enhancing the Aβ1–42/Aβ1–40 ratio, it remains unclear whether and how they affect the generation of APP intracellular domain (AICD). Moreover, controversy exists as to how PS1 mutations exert their effects in different experimental systems, by either increasing Aβ1–42 production, decreasing Aβ1–40 production, or both. Because it could be explained by the heterogeneity in the composition of γ-secretase, we purified to homogeneity complexes made of human NCT, APH1aL, PEN2, and the pathogenic PS1 mutants L166P, ΔE9, or P436Q.Methodology/Principal FindingsWe took advantage of a mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line lacking PS1 and PS2 to generate different stable cell lines overexpressing human γ-secretase complexes with different FAD-linked PS1 mutations. A multi-step affinity purification procedure was used to isolate semi-purified or highly purified γ-secretase complexes. The functional characterization of these complexes revealed that all PS1 FAD-linked mutations caused a loss of γ-secretase activity phenotype, in terms of Aβ1–40, Aβ1–42 and APP intracellular domain productions in vitro.Conclusion/SignificanceOur data support the view that PS1 mutations lead to a strong γ-secretase loss-of-function phenotype and an increased Aβ1–42/Aβ1–40 ratio, two mechanisms that are potentially involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.Citation: Cacquevel M, Aeschbach L, Houacine J, Fraering PC (2012) Alzheimer's Disease-Linked Mutations in Presenilin-1 Result in a Drastic Loss of Activity in Purified γ-Secretase Complexes.

PSEN1 and PSEN2 encode transmembrane proteins PS1 and PS2, respectively, that constitute the catalytic core of γ-secretase, the founding member of an emerging class of unconventional, Intramembrane-Cleaving Proteases (I-CLiPs) [3]. Active γ-secretase is a multiprotein complex composed of PS1 or PS2 together with nicastrin (NCT), the anterior pharynx-defective protein 1 (APH1), and the presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2). Experimental evidence such as the binding of transition-state analogue γ-secretase inhibitors to PS1 [4], as well as the abolishment of γ-secretase activity when PS1 lacks the aspartate residues critical for proteolysis [4], [5], [6], have confirmed that presenilins harbour the active site of the enzymatic complex.PS1 and PS2 play fundamental roles in cell signalling as part of the γ-secretase complex. The latter cleaves numerous type-I membrane proteins in their transmembrane domain [7], releasing their corresponding intracellular domains, which are capable of influencing gene expression. For some substrates like NOTCH1 or ERBB4, the γ-secretase cleavage is essential for their biological function, whereas for other substrates like DCC or NEUREXIN-3β [8], the possible role of the cleavage in signalling events has not been formally established (see [9] for a review). The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is processed by the successive actions of β-secretase (BACE1) and γ-secretase, generating amyloid-beta peptides (Aβ) of different lengths, ranging from 37 to 46 amino acids [10]. Cleavage of the APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs) by γ-secretase also releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD), which has been recently involved in the regulation of brain ApoE expression, a major genetic determinant of AD, and in cholesterol metabolism [11]. In addition, PS1 has been shown to interact with a growing list of proteins that modulate γ-secretase activity [9], [12], [13], [14].In a pathological context, 185 missense mutations in PSEN1 and 13 mutations in PSEN2 have been identified and found to be associated with FAD (www.molgen.ua.ac.be/ADMutations). It was initially suggested that such mutations lead to a toxic gain of function because they are associated with a relative increased production of longer and more hydrophobic Aβ species, mainly Aβ1–42, that accumulate and aggregate early in the course of the disease [15], [16]. Similar phenotypes have been observed by independent groups in cell-based studies performed with different mammalian cell lines [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]. Despite this growing consensus, the above-mentioned studies provided conflicting results regarding the relative proportions of Aβ42, Aβ40, and AICD resulting from the PSEN mutations. On one hand, a gain-of-function phenotype was suggested due to the observed increase in Aβ42 production, accompanied or not with reduced Aβ40 production, thereby leading to an increased Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio. On the other hand, reduced AICD production suggested a loss-of-function phenotype [20]. Differences in the methodologies and cell types used to assess the effects of PSEN mutations on Aβ and AICD productions can explain this controversy as to how PS mutations exert their effects. For example, endogenous PS has been suggested to affect such analysis, as the FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations led to a decrease in the total amount of Aβ generated in PS1 and PS2 double knockout cells [23]. Next, it has been reported that γ-secretase complexes are heterogeneous in composition (with two PS genes and three APH1 isoforms, six combinations of γ-secretase are possible), with distinct functional properties influencing the relative amount of Aβ species generated [24]. In order to investigate the biochemical and functional properties of γ-secretase in cell-free systems, we and others have recently purified this enzymatic complex to homogeneity [25], [26], [27]. In particular, protocols for the high-grade purification of proteolytically active γ-secretase constituted of NCT, APH1aL, PEN2 and wild-type PS1 [26], [27] allowed the reconstitution of 3D structures at 15 Å and 12 Å resolution by EM and cryo-EM and gave new insights on the structure and activity of the enzyme [28], [29]. However, these studies were exclusively focused on the wild-type PS1. Here, we report for the first time the functional characterization of highly purified and homogenous human γ-secretase particles carrying different FAD-linked PS1 mutants. Our biochemical and functional findings strongly suggest that pathogenic mutations in PSEN1 cause a loss of γ-secretase activity.Results Top Generation, selection and characterization of stable cell lines overexpressing γ-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutantsIn order to facilitate high-grade purification of homogenous human γ-secretase complexes containing different PS1 variants, we took advantage of a previously generated mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell line that lacks the two presenilins (PS1/2−/−) [30], [31]. Our global strategy consisted in producing stable cell lines, on a PS1/2−/− background, that overexpress tagged versions of the three human γ-secretase subunits NCT, APH1 and PEN2 together with different variants of human PS1, and to purify the different human γ-secretase complexes by three sequential affinity purification steps. This strategy allowed us to exclude a possible co-purification of mouse γ-secretase components. First, a parental cell line was generated by co-transducing lentiviral vectors of human NCT-V5 (hNCT-V5), human APH1aL-HA (hAPH1aL-HA) and human Flag-PEN2 (Flag-hPEN2) into MEF PS1/2−/−. Lentivectors are stably integrated into the cell genome and allow the generation of cell lines overexpressing multiple genes in a short period of time. Next, the clone expressing the highest levels of all three recombinant proteins was selected (designated γ - PS1/2) and used as the parental cell line that was further transduced with lentivectors carrying the following different human PS1 variants: PS1-WT, three dominant-negative forms of PS1 that lack the crucial, catalytic site aspartate residues (D257A, D385A, and both D257A/D385A referred to as DDAA later in the article), and three FAD-linked PS1 mutants (L166P, ΔE9 and P436Q, with mean disease onset at 24 years, 45.5 years and 28.3 years, respectively).For each PS1 variant, two individual clones were selected based on the expression levels of the recombinant proteins, and extensively characterized (Figure 1). To distinguish those cell lines overexpressing all γ-sectease components from wild-type MEFs, they are collectively designated γ-MEFs. As shown in Figure 1A, the analysis of total protein extracts confirmed that PS is required for the maturation of NCT and the stability of PEN2 [23], [32]. As expected, and when compared to the parental γ- PS1/2 cell line, higher levels of the mature form of NCT were observed in all PS1-overexpressing clones. In contrast to PEN2, APH1aL levels were relatively similar in all PS1 clones and the parental cell line. Indeed, and as previously reported [23], [32], PEN2 levels were higher in the clones overexpressing WT PS1 and FAD-linked PS1 mutants, and to a lesser extent in the clones overexpressing the dominant negative forms of PS1. Interestingly, PEN2 migrated on the gel as an apparent double band, possibly reflecting a post-translational modification. Different patterns of PS1 expression and autoproteolysis were observed in the different clones. First, and in sharp contrast to the other clones, those expressing PS1-WT or PS1-L166P displayed higher levels of PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF fragments compared with full-length PS1 (PS1-FL; Figure 1A). As estimated by densitometry, the NTF fragments of PS1-WT and PS1-L166P account for 87±2% and 79±7% of total PS1 (PS1-NTF+PS1-FL), respectively. Next, the PS1-ΔE9 clones did not show any detectable NTF or CTF fragments, as previously described [33], while P436Q and the three dominant negative variants of PS1 were characterized by low levels of PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF fragments, suggesting that these variants were less prone to endoproteolysis.thumbnailFigure 1. Generation of stable cell lines overexpressing all human γ-secretase components with FAD-linked PS1 variants.MEF PS1/2−/− were stably co-transduced with lentiviral vectors carrying genes encoding hNCT-V5, Flag-hPEN2, hAPH1aL-HA and clones were isolated by limiting dilution to generate a cell line, designated as γ- PS1/2, that overexpresses high amount of the three subunits. γ- PS1/2 MEFs were further transduced with hPS1 variants harbouring FAD-linked mutations or mutations in the catalytic aspartate residue(s), or PS1-WT, and cloned. Each clone, derived form the γ- PS1/2, was conveniently named according to the mutation present in PS1 preceded by the symbol γ and followed by the number of the clone (γ-MEF) in order to distinguish them from wild-type MEF (WT MEF) and MEF PS1/2−/−. Two clones per γ-secretase variant were selected for characterization. (A–B) Whole cell protein extracts of the different cell lines were prepared in 1% NP40-HEPES buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE on 4–12% Bis-Tris or 12% Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining to detect the γ-secretase core components NCT (NCT164), PS1 (NTF, MAB1563; CTF; MAB5232), APH1aL-HA (3F10), and Flag-PEN2 (M2) (A), and endogenous APP (A8717) (B). β-Actin was used as a loading control. Each lane represents one selected clone.

As expected, and as indicated by increased levels of intracellular APP-CTFs (a common characteristic among known substrates in response to γ-secretase pharmacological inhibition), the activity of γ-secretase was significantly altered in the PS deficient parental γ - PS1/2 cell line as well as in all clones expressing dominant negative forms of PS1 (Figure 1B). In the clones expressing PS1-WT, APP-CTFs were almost undetectable due to high γ-secretase activity, while clones expressing PS1-L166P or PS1-P436Q displayed APP-CTF accumulation. In PS1-ΔE9 clones, a mild APP-CTF accumulation was observed (Figure 1B). Although a poor recovery of γ-secretase activity for the PS1-L166P and a comparatively better performance of PS1-ΔE9 have been reported by others under similar experimental conditions [23], the potential of PS1-P436Q mutation to restore the processing of endogenous APP-CTFs has never been assessed [34], [35]. Importantly, all observations described above for the cells overexpressing simultaneously hNCT-V5, hAPH1aL-HA, Flag-hPEN2 and the different PS1 variants are very consistent with those made in MEF PS1/2−/− cells overexpressing only the PS1 variants, in the absence of the other γ-secretase components (cf. Figure S1A). These data suggest that the effect of FAD mutations in PS1 on APP-CTFs accumulation was similar in presence or absence of other human components of the γ-secretase.Next, we further investigated the effect of PS1 variants on the cellular production/secretion of Aβ species. For this purpose, and as described elsewhere [36], we used an APP-based γ-secretase substrate with a Flag tag at its C-terminus (SPA4CT-Flag). This substrate was transduced in the above-described γ-secretase overexpressing stable cell lines (γ-MEFs) as well as in wild-type MEFs, and APP-CTFs and Aβ levels were measured in cell lysate and cell media, respectively (Figure 2). Under these conditions, the overexpression of SPA4CT-Flag led to an accumulation of two bands corresponding to the exogenous substrate, associated with a concomitant decrease of endogenous APP-CTFs levels (Figure 2A and Figure S2). As estimated by ELISA, a three-fold increase in Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 levels was observed in the cell culture media of cell lines overexpressing human γ-secretase (γ-MEF WT), in comparison to untransduced WT MEFs (Figure 2B). Also, the average Aβ1–42/Aβ1–40 ratios were not significantly different in those cell lines (Mean ± SD: γ-MEF WT#5: 0.30±0.01; γ-MEF WT#8: 0.29±0.01; WT MEF: 0.19±0.06). Next, overexpression of SPA4CT-Flag in γ-MEFs led to the pronounced intracellular accumulation of APP-CTFs in cells overexpressing the PS1 aspartate mutants (Figure 2C), and to the secretion in the cell culture media of different Aβ levels as measured by ELISA (Figure 2D). First, only traces of both Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 were detected in γ-MEFs overexpressing PS1 with aspartate mutants. Next, γ-MEFs overexpressing PS1 with FAD-linked mutations displayed a pronounced variability in Aβ levels when compared to the wild-type clones. Overall, the average Aβ1–40 levels were decreased in these cell lines (Mean of two clones in pg/mL ± SD: WT: 224.6±0.1, L166P: 84.3±34.2, ΔE9: 167.2±40.7, P436Q: 82.8±74.7), while the Aβ1–42 levels were increased (Mean of two clones in pg/mL ± SD: WT: 69.9±7.9, L166P: 310.7±81.0, ΔE9: 94.4±18.5, P436Q: 141.1±98.5). Consistent with previously reported data, the Aβ1–42/Aβ1–40 ratios were increased in all γ-MEF clones overexpressing PS1 with FAD-linked mutations (Figure 2D) (Mean of two clones pg/mL ± SD: WT: 0.31±0.03, L166P: 3.8±0.58, ΔE9: 0.6±0.03, P436Q: 2.0±0.59).thumbnailFigure 2. Aβ production in cell lines overexpressing human γ-secretase components with FAD-linked PS1 variants.WT MEF, γ-MEF and γ - PS1/2 were transduced with an APP-based substrate corresponding to the 99 C-terminal residues of human APP fused to the APP signal peptide in N-terminus (SPA4CT [36]) and a Flag Tag in C-terminus. Cell proteins were extracted in 1% NP40-HEPES buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining with an antibody targeting the C-terminal part of APP (A8717) (A, C). Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 levels were also measured in the corresponding cell culture media (B, D). Data corresponds to three independent experiments (Mean ± SEM).doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035133.g002 FAD-linked PS1 mutations alter the activity of semi-purified γ-secretase complexesWe next assessed the activity of γ-secretase with FAD-linked PS1 mutations in microsomal extracts of γ-MEFs. Membrane protein extracts were prepared and γ-secretase activity was assayed on an exogenous recombinant APP-based substrate consisting of the C-terminal 99 amino acid residues of APP, and referred to as C100-Flag (Figure 3A). The generation of the cleavage product AICD-Flag was detected by Western blot analysis and measured by densitometry. As shown in Figure 3A, the levels of AICD-Flag generated from the PS1-L166P and PS1-ΔE9 clones accounted for 42±1% and 13±6% of that in the PS1-WT clones, respectively. AICD-Flag was undetectable in the clones expressing PS1-P436Q as well as in the three dominant negative aspartate PS1 variants. Similar results were observed in MEF PS1/2−/− cells overexpressing only the PS1 variants, in the absence of the other human γ-secretase components (Figure S1B).thumbnailFigure 3. Enzymatic activity of partially purified γ-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants.(A) γ-Secretase activity assays performed with γ-MEF and γ - PS1/2 microsomal extracts prepared in 1% CHAPSO-HEPES buffer. Equal protein levels from the different extracts were diluted to 0.25% CHAPSO-HEPES buffer and incubated for 4 h at 37°C with lipids and 1 µM of recombinant human APP-based substrate (C100-Flag). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunostained with anti-Flag (M2) or anti-PS1 (MAB1563). The relative amounts of AICD-Flag generated in the reactions, reflecting γ-secretase activity, were estimated by densitometry. PS1 immunostaining was used to assess the amount of input material. (B) Equal amounts of microsomal proteins were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4°C with either anti-Flag M2 or anti-HA affinity resins, and submitted to a C100-His assay according to the same protocol as in (A). Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and analysed by immunostaining for γ-secretase subunits ((NCT164 (NCT), MAB1563 (PS1-NTF), or UD1 (PEN2)). AICD-His cleavage products were immunostained with an anti-APP-CTF antibody (A8717). *Indicates a non-specific band corresponding to the IgG light chains. (C) Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 were quantified by sandwich ELISA and represented in pg/mL (left Y-axis) or in percentage (right Y-axis) of the mean of Aβ1–40 levels generated by the two wild-type clones. Aβ1–42/Aβ1–40 ratios are indicated on the top of the bars. The results were confirmed in three independent experiments and a representative dataset is shown.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035133.g003 We next performed activity assays under semi-purified conditions. To do so, γ-secretase complexes from the different clones were co-immunoprecipitated from microsomal extracts and their activities were assayed in vitro with the C100-His substrate. Two immunoprecipitation protocols using two affinity resins (anti-Flag M2 and anti-HA 3F10, targeting respectively Flag-PEN2 and APH1aL-HA) were compared to exclude a possible heterogeneity of γ-secretase complexes potentially generated under such conditions. As shown in Figure 3B, the anti-Flag and anti-HA resins immunoprecipitated similar levels of NCT, PS1 and PEN2 and the activity of the γ-secretase complexes was similar regardless of the affinity resins used (Figures 3B). In agreement with the assays performed using microsomal extracts (Figure 3A), those performed with semi-purified complexes revealed that FAD-linked mutants drastically reduced AICD generation, when compared to PS1-WT (Figure 3B). Furthermore, levels of Aβ1–40 produced from PS1-L166P, PS1-ΔE9 and P436Q variants fell respectively to ~6%, ~1.5% and ~0.5%, when compared to these produced from PS1-WT γ-secretase. Following the same tendency, Aβ1–42 levels generated from PS1-L166P, PS1-ΔE9 and PS1-P436Q γ-secretase variants were respectively estimated to ~20%, ~5% and ~3% of these produced with PS1-WT-containing complexes. The Aβ1-42/Aβ1–40 ratio measured for WT γ-MEFs was consistent with our cell-based data (compare Figures 2D and 3C), validating our in vitro experimental conditions. Interestingly, an overall Aβ1–42/Aβ1–40 ratio of ~1 was estimated for all PS1 mutants, with the exception of P436Q#4 (~2). However, in the latter, the ratio may have been overestimated because the Aβ1–40 levels measured were at the detection limit. This similarity in the Aβ1–42/Aβ1–40 ratios generated by the different mutants has, to the best of our knowledge, never been observed in previous studies.Highly purified γ-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants display a loss-of-function phenotypeIn order to further investigate how PS1 variants affect APP-CTF cleavage and to validate our observations performed in semi-purified conditions, we purified to homogeneity γ-secretase complexes from the selected clones described in Figure 1. The purification process (described in details under Materials &amp; Methods and depicted in Figure 4A) involved three sequential affinity purifications starting from microsomal extracts. Since all cell lines were generated on a PS knockout background, this strategy allowed us to purify exclusively and selectively γ-secretase complexes made of human components. As highlighted in Figure 4B, our protocol led to the production of stable, high molecular weight γ-secretase complexes (HMWCs) with an apparent molecular mass on Blue Native (BN)-PAGE of ~350 kDa, which is consistent with previous reports [26], [27], [37]. The silver stained particles on the BN gel confirmed the high purity of these complexes (Figure 4B, upper panel), for which the identity was established by cross-reactivity with antibodies specific to NCT and PS1 (Figure 4B, lower panels). As the main goal of this experiment was to compare the efficacy of the different γ-secretase complexes to process APP-based substrates, it is important to note that the final yields of the complexes purified from the different clones were very similar (Figure 4B), thus facilitating further comparative analyses. The immunoblot analysis of the purified complexes (Figure 4C) confirmed the presence of all core components (NCT-V5, APH1aL-HA, Flag-PEN2 and PS1) and globally recapitulates the maturation processes observed in the Figure 1. Interestingly, the relative PS1-NTF/CTF to PS1-FL ratios in the purified γ-secretase complexes containing the three PS1 dominant-negative or the PS1-P436Q variants were higher than those estimated in the whole cell extracts before purification (Figure 1A), indicating that endoproteolysis of PS1 was not completely abolished by these mutations. To assess how FAD-linked mutations in PS1 affect γ-secretase activity in these purified complexes, we performed in vitro assays by using C100-Flag substrate (Figure 3A) and equal amounts of the different purified complexes, immediately after the purification to avoid freezing/thawing cycles that might affect enzymatic activity. As shown in Figure 5A, γ-secretase activity based on AICD-Flag production was easily detected in complexes purified from the two PS1-WT clones. This is in sharp contrast to the other purified complexes that did not generate detectable AICD under our experimental conditions (Figure 5A). Next, sandwich ELISAs directed against Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 were performed in order to further characterize the specific activity of the purified complexes. Reflecting the levels of AICD and considering the detection limits of our sandwich ELISA, the production of both Aβ species by γ-secretase complexes containing PS1-WT was at least 10-fold higher than in complexes with the FAD-linked or dominant-negative PS1 variants (Figure 5B). The Aβ1–42/Aβ1–40 ratio measured in PS1-WT γ-secretase complexes (~0.22) was similar to that previously reported [26], [27], thus excluding a possible qualitative alteration of γ-secretase activity with this protocol. Together, our results strongly support the hypothesis that the pathogenic L166P, ΔE9, and P436Q mutations in PSEN1 cause a drastic loss (at least 90% as estimated by ELISA) of γ-secretase activity.thumbnailFigure 4. High-grade purification of human γ-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants.(A) Schematic representation of the γ-secretase purification process. Briefly, Presenilin double-knockout MEFs were used to first generate cell lines that stably overexpress human γ-secretase complexes containing different PS1 variants. Next, these cell lines were used for a multi-step purification procedure as described in the material and methods. (B) Blue-Native PAGE analysis of purified γ-secretase complexes made of different PS1 variants. Equal volumes of the different purified γ-secretase preparations were separated by native-PAGE on a 4–16% Bis-Tris gel, and stained with silver nitrate (top panel), or immunostained for NCT (NCT164, middle panel) or PS1-NTF (ab10281, bottom panel) as indicated. γ-Secretase complexes appeared on the gel as high molecular weight complexes (HMWCs) of ~350 kDa. Note that the levels of HMWCs were similar for all clones. (C) Equal volumes of purified γ-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants were separated under denaturing conditions (SDS-PAGE) and immunostained with anti-NCT (NCT164), anti-PS1-NTF (MAB1563), anti-PS1-CTF (MAB5232), anti-HA (3F10), or anti-Flag (M2) antibodies. Two independent purifications were performed on each clone with similar results. A representative dataset is shown.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035133.g004 thumbnailFigure 5. Enzymatic activity of highly purified γ-secretase complexes with FAD-linked or aspartate PS1 mutants.Equal amounts of the different purified γ-secretase preparations characterized in Figure 4 were tested for activity on C100-Flag, as described in Figure 3. The resulting cleavage products were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunostaining with an anti-Flag antibody (M2) for C100-Flag or AICD-Flag (A), and by sandwich ELISA for Aβ1–40 or Aβ1–42 (B). Note that the levels of Aβ produced from FAD-linked γ-secretase complexes were all in the non-linear range of the ELISA standards, close to the detection limit. Whenever possible, Aβ1–42/Aβ1–40 ratios were quantified and indicated on the top of the bars. Two independent purifications were performed on each clone and similar results were obtained. A representative dataset is shown.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035133.g005 Discussion Top Several conflicting results as to how Alzheimer's disease-linked mutations in PSEN1 affect the processing of APP by γ-secretase have been reported. First, it has been previously reported that transgenic animals with FAD-linked PS1 mutations show increasing brain levels of Aβ1–42 [15], [38]. Since Aβ1–42, the first Aβ specie deposited in the brain of AD patients [16], [39], is more prone to aggregation when compared to shorter Aβ species [40], [41], [42], it has been implicated in the seeding of amyloid plaques in AD patients with PSEN1 mutations [43]. This was further validated in vivo as the overexpression of PS1 mutants in APP transgenic mice accelerated the rate of Aβ accumulation and deposition in the brain [44], [45]. However, Bentahir and colleagues challenged this view by showing that several PSEN1 mutations were also capable to decrease total Aβ production in PS1/PS2 knockout cells [23]. These findings suggested that endogenous PS1 and PS2 may influence the mutant phenotype in cells or in vivo. By extension, we hypothesized that the other components of γ-secretase, namely APH1, NCT and PEN2, may influence the mutant phenotype as well. Indeed, γ-secretase complexes are heterogeneous in composition due to the existence of two human APH1 genes, APH1a and APH1b, and two splicing isoforms of APH1a (S and L), as well as two presenilin genes, PSEN1 and PSEN2. Therefore, it is plausible that a single mutation in PSEN1 confers different catalytic properties to distinct γ-secretase subtypes. This hypothesis is supported by recent investigations showing that APH1 variants can modulate Aβ profiles. When compared to APH1aS or L, overexpression of APH1b in MEF knockout for all APH1 genes led to increased production of longer Aβ species [24]. With this regard, it is important to note that all four mouse variants of APH1 are expressed in the MEF cell line used in previous studies [23] and employed here (cf. Figure S3). Since the phenotype of PS1 mutations have mainly been assessed in vivo or in cell-based systems, we investigated the effects of FAD-linked PS1 mutants on the processing of APP-CTFs in cell-free systems, by using semi-purified and purified enzymatic complexes isolated from MEF PS1/PS2 double knockout cells stably overexpressing differentially tagged human γ-secretase components. Under these conditions, the biochemical and functional properties of γ-secretase complexes bearing either FAD-linked PS1 mutants (L166P, ΔE9, and P436Q), dominant-negative forms of PS1 or wild-type PS1 were characterized. The activity of γ-secretase with PS1-WT was similar to that reported for γ-secretase purified from our CHO cells overexpressing NCT-V5, APH1aL, Flag-PEN2 and PS1-WT [26], [27], that resulted in Aβ1–42/Aβ1–40 ratios between 0.1 and 0.3. In contrast, we found a major loss in the activity of γ-secretase complexes containing either the dominant-negative PS1 variants or the FAD-linked PS1 mutants. Although a total loss of activity was expected for the dominant negative forms of γ-secretase [5], [6], [32], the drastic loss of activity seen here with the FAD-linked PS1 mutants was unexpected. Indeed, the PS1-L166P variant has previously been reported to increase Aβ1–42 levels both in vivo [46] and in vitro [20], in the presence of endogenous PS1, PS2 and APH1 components. In contrast, Bentahir and colleagues found that PS1-L166P decreased both Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 production in a PS knockout background. These results are consistent with our in vitro data, although the reduction in Aβ1–42 and Aβ1–40 production was more pronounced in our system. However, they differ from our cell-based data in which we observed an increase in Aβ1–42 associated with a decrease in Aβ1–40. Taken together, these data suggest that the overexpression of the other human components of γ-secretase can influence the phenotype of FAD-linked mutations. Another possible explanation for these discrepancies comes from the use, in previously described cellular systems, of APP carrying the Swedish mutation (K670M/N671L) [20], [23], [46]. Initially, this APP variant was shown to enhance the production of all Aβ species by favouring its β-secretase cleavage [47], [48]. However, Munter and colleagues recently demonstrated that the APP Swedish mutation can also affect the specificity of the γ-secretase cleavage [49]. In particular, these authors showed that over-expression of APP Swedish in a neuronal cell line led to a 4-fold increase in secreted Aβ42, associated with only a 2-fold increase of total Aβ, compared with the wild-type APP. Therefore, one cannot exclude the possibility of differential interactions between PS1-WT or PS1 variants and different APP variants, as suggested earlier [50].As far as the PS1-ΔE9 mutant is concerned, previous cell-based studies have reported a decrease in Aβ40 levels associated with an increase in Aβ42 levels [51], [52], or no changes in Aβ40 levels despite increased Aβ42 levels [53], or a decrease in both Aβ species [23]. In the present study, Aβ1–40, Aβ1–42, as well as AICD levels generated from purified γ-secretase complexes with PS1-ΔE9 were close to the limit of detection, resulting in a loss of at least 95% of the γ-secretase activity compared to wild-type PS1. Similarly, we found a near to complete loss of γ-secretase activity for complexes with the aggressive PS1-P436Q mutant (mean onset: 28.3 years) [54]. Consistent with a recent study [35], and in contrast to PS1-L166P, the maturation of the full-length PS1-P436Q protein into PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF was impaired. Interestingly, the same study also reported that P436Q variant showed a decreased γ-secretase activity and Aβ40 and Aβ42 secretion in PS1/PS2 double knockout cells (~75% or ~50% of the control for Aβ40 or Aβ42, respectively), but to a lesser extent than what we measured in this study (more than 97% for both Aβ species).Overall, our data show that, under our experimental conditions, the FAD-linked PS1 mutants cause a drastic loss of activity (at least 90%) in the highly purified and homogeneous as well as semi-purified γ-secretase complexes. This loss-of-function is asymmetrical as Aβ1–42 levels were relatively less affected than Aβ1–40 levels. Interestingly, the ratio between the two Aβ species was similar for the variants tested here (~1), suggesting a common modulatory mechanism. Our findings further support a model in which the subtype of γ-secretase containing APH1aL and FAD-linked PS1 mutants generates a higher Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio compared to PS1-WT, as previously observed in vivo [15], [38]. Taken together, the overall reduction in Aβ levels strongly suggest that other regulatory mechanisms or cellular components may exist and account for the strong amyloid pathology observed in AD patients carrying these FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations. In agreement with this hypothesis, we report that the phenotype of FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations is different whether we consider the cell-based or the cell-free conditions. Indeed, even if Aβ42/Aβ40 ratios were globally increased in both experimental conditions, Aβ production was strikingly different.One possible explanation would be that specific subtypes of γ-secretase complexes are less affected than others by PSEN1 mutations. For instance, it remains unknown whether γ-secretase complexes carrying APH1b or APH1aS are similarly affected by PSEN1 mutations. In support to that regard, Winkler and colleagues recently purified human γ-secretase with PS1-L166P and observed that such complexes, containing both APH1a and AHP1b, led to increased Aβ1–42 production associated with decreased Aβ1–40 production, as compared to the PS1-WT complexes. Another possible explanation would be that purified γ-secretase complexes lack binding partners modulating the processing of APP-based substrates, due to purification conditions affecting physical interactions of proteins. These include TMP21 or the recently reported γ-secretase activating protein (GSAP) [12], [13]. Further biochemical analyses are needed to test this hypothesis.The loss of activity in γ-secretase containing PS1 variants also leads to decreased generation of AICD. As AICD is involved in the transcriptional regulation of several genes, including the neprilysin [55], and the lipoprotein receptor, LRP1 [11], it is likely that mutations in PSEN1 impair the regulation of these genes in vivo. For instance, it is possible that unknown genes transcriptionally regulated in vivo by the AICD might influence Aβ metabolism in return. In support to these views, Veeraraghavalu and colleagues recently demonstrated that Notch signalling was impaired in transgenic mice overexpressing PS1 mutants, albeit in the presence of endogenous PS1-WT and all APH1 isoforms [56]. They found decreased self-renewal and differentiation of neuronal precursor cells in the subventricular zone, suggesting that the loss-of-function phenotype of PSEN1 mutations can also be observed in heterogeneous conditions. These results are reminiscent of the previous report from Saura and colleagues showing that conditional inactivation of both presenilins in vivo induces age-dependent neurodegeneration associated with memory impairment [57]. Altogether, the above-described data suggest that alternative pathways of neurodegeneration related to loss of γ-secretase functions are possible and relevant to AD. They further support the concept that modulating rather than inhibiting γ-secretase activity would be a more appropriate therapeutic strategy for AD [58]. Supporting this view, the γ-secretase inhibitor Semagacestat tested in phase III clinical trials not only failed to slow cognitive decline in patients with mild-to-moderate AD, but actually made it worse [59].Collectively, our findings support a model in which FAD-linked mutations in PSEN1 likely induce Aβ pathology by perturbing the relative ratio between Aβ species and by impairing developmental and cellular signalling pathways controlled by γ-secretase substrates. This deleterious dual effect might explain why FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations cause early onset Alzheimer's disease. Since it has been established that Aβ and AICD are generated following the processing by γ-secretase at two distinct gamma- and epsilon-cleavage sites in APP [60], further investigation is now required to better understand whether and how FAD mutations in PS1 differentially affect the epsilon versus gamma-cleavage sites in APP, as well as in other known γ-secretase substrates.Materials and Methods Top DNA Constructs and mutagenesisNCT-V5, Flag-PEN2, APH1aL-HA, wild-type PS1 human cDNAs (PS1-WT) were obtained from D. Selkoe (Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA). PS1 ΔE9 cDNA was obtained from C. Saura (Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Spain). PS1 D257A and PS1 D385A cDNAs were obtained from M. Wolfe (Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA). Mutations in PSEN1, namely, L166P and P436Q, were generated by PCR-based mutagenesis on the plasmid pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+)-PS1-WT using T7 or BGH primers (specific to the plasmid DNA sequence) together with the corresponding primers: L166P Rv: 5′ CAG CAA CAA Taa gct tGA TAT AAT AGG 3′; L166P Fw: 5′ CTT ATT ATA TCa agc ttA TTG TTG CTG 3′; P436Q Rv: 5′ TCG AGT TTA Gaa gct tTC TTG AAA ATG GCA AGG AG 3′; P436Q Fw: 5′ TCG AGT TTA Gaa gct tTG CCA GCT CTT CAA ATC TCC 3′. The sequences corresponding to enzyme restriction sites are given in small letters. The PCR fragments were next digested with BamHI/HindIII and HindIII/XhoI respectively, and were subcloned into pcDNA3. PS1 D257A/D385A (DDAA) was obtained by subcloning the DraI/XhoI digested fragment of PS1 D385A into pcDNA3.1-PS1 D257A. The APP based substrate SPA4CT-Flag, corresponding to the signal peptide of APP fused to the APP-C99-Flag with a small linker region (DA) [36], was obtained by removing the HindIII/EcoRI fragment of pcDNA3-APP695-Flag and inserting the following annealed primers: 5′ AGC TTA TGC TGC CCG GTT TG GCA CTG CTC CTG CTG GCC GCC TGG ACG GCT CGG GCG GAT GCA GAT GCA G 3′ and 5′ AAT TCT GCA TCT GCA TCC GCC CGA GCC GTC CAG GCG GCC AGC AGG AGC AGT GCC AAA CCG GGC AGC ATA 3′. All constructs were next subcloned into the self-inactivated vector pSIN-PGK-WHV cassette (a kind gift from R. Zufferey, Brain Mind Institute, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland). Inserts for plasmids pET21-C100-Flag, and pET21-C100-His were generated by PCR as previously described [27]. Plasmids pMD2G and psPAX2 were obtained from D. Trono (Global Health Institute, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland).Lentivector productionReplication-defective lentiviral particles were produced by a three-plasmid transient transfection of cells from the human embryonic kidney HEK 293T cell line [61]. Briefly, cells were incubated in 10 cm dishes until they reached 70% confluence and were transiently co-transfected by the calcium phosphate method, with 5 µg of envelope plasmid (pMD2G), 15 µg of packaging plasmid (psPAX2), and 20 µg of vector plasmids (pSIN-PGK-WHV). Cells were incubated overnight with DNA-calcium precipitates, washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) and incubated with 7 mL of DMEM. After 24 h, the conditioned medium was harvested and cells were incubated a second time with 7 mL of DMEM for 24 h. Media were then pooled, passed through 0.45 µm filter, and stored at −80°C as 2 mL aliquots until use. A p24 ELISA (Zeptometrix corporation) was performed on each batch of media in order to evaluate the number of viral particles generated.Generation of stable cell lines through multiple gene transductionsMouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs, obtained from B. De Strooper, Flanders University Institute of Biotechnology, Belgium) defective in PSEN1 and PSEN2 [30], [31] were cultivated in 10 cm dishes in DMEM, supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin/streptomycin (P/S) (Invitrogen). A first set of stable cell lines was generated by co-transducing NCT-V5, APH1aL-HA, and Flag-PEN2 containing lentiviral vectors (LV) repeatedly for two weeks at each passage (1/20). Ten clones were isolated by the limiting dilution method and were further screened for NCT-V5, Flag-PEN2 and APH1aL-HA expression by immunodetection. The clone that showed the highest expression of the three proteins (designated γ - PS1/2) was used as the parental cell line to generate the stable cell lines expressing different PS1 variants, by the same method and by using lentiviral vectors carrying human PS1-WT, PS1-L166P, PS1-ΔE9, PS1-P436Q, PS1-D257A, PS1-D385A, and PS1-DDAA. For each PS1 variant, five clones were selected for a full characterization and two of them were further used for γ-secretase purification. For SPA4CT overexpression experiments, 500,000 cells of each clone were exposed to the same arbitrary dose of lentiviral vectors carrying human SPA4CT-Flag in 2 mL of DMEM, 1% FBS, P/S and were plated in 6-wells plates for 72 h. The medium was next replaced by fresh DMEM, 2% FBS, P/S for 24 h. Finally, cell culture medium was harvested, supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), centrifuged for 3 min at 1,000× rpm and frozen at −80°C until further processing. Cells were washed in PBS and submitted to protein extraction.Protein extractionTotal protein extracts were prepared in 1% NP40 - HEPES buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM CaCl2), supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), and were clarified by centrifugation for 1 h at 16,000× g, 4°C. Cell membranes were obtained as described below and solubilised in 1% CHAPSO - HEPES buffer and centrifuged at 16,000× g for 1 h. Supernatants corresponding to the microsomal protein extracts were harvested and stored at −80°C. Protein content of the extracts was estimated by the BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce).Multi-step purification of human γ-secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 variants1) Cell membrane preparation. MEF PS1/PS2 DKO cells (1.0×109 cells) expressing NCT-V5, Flag-PEN2, APH1aL-HA and different forms of PS1: wild type (WT), or with FAD-linked variants or lacking the critical aspartate residues, were collected from 15 cm dishes and fully resuspended in 40 mL of MES buffer (50 mM MES, pH 6.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM CaCl2), supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Next, cells were passed four times through a high-pressure homogenizer (Emulsiflex-C5, Avestin Inc, ON Canada) at a pressure greater than 1,000 psi. Nuclei and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 3,000× g for 20 min at 4°C in a Beckman Coulter Allegra X-15R centrifuge. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 100,000× g for 1 h at 4°C in a SW32Ti rotor using a Beckman Coulter Optima L-80 ultracentrifuge to recover the membrane preparation in the pellet. 2) Bicarbonate wash. The membrane pellet was fully resuspended in 1.6 mL of ice cold sodium bicarbonate buffer (0.1 M NaHCO3, pH 11.3) by pipetting up and down at least 30 times, and incubated at 4°C for 20 min. The washed membranes were then centrifuged at 100,000× g for 1 h at 4°C and stored at −80°C until use. 3) Solubilisation of γ-secretase complexes. The bicarbonate-washed membranes were fully resuspended in 1.7 mL of 1% CHAPSO - HEPES buffer by pipetting up and down at least 30 times. The membranes were then incubated at 4°C for 1 h. To pellet the insoluble material, the solution was centrifuged at 16,000× g at 4°C for 1 h, the pellet was discarded, and the supernatant saved. This lysate is defined as “solubilised γ-secretase preparation”. Next, these freshly prepared solubilised preparations were used for affinity purification of γ-secretase complexes as described below. 4) Anti-Flag M2 affinity purification. The solubilised γ-secretase preparations were first diluted 1:2 with HEPES buffer, and further diluted 1:6 with 0.1% digitonin - TBS buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl) (final detergent concentration: 0.08% CHAPSO, 0.08% digitonin) and incubated overnight at 4°C with agitation after adding 200 µL of anti-Flag M2 affinity resin beads (Sigma-Aldrich) that had been pre-equilibrated in 0.1% Digitonin - TBS buffer. The beads were washed 3 times in the same buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted over 4 h at 4°C with 0.4 mL of this buffer containing 200 µg/mL of Flag peptides (Sigma-Aldrich). This elution step was repeated once for 1 h at 4°C and the eluted fractions were pooled and designated “M2 pooled 800 µL fractions”. 5) Anti-V5 affinity purification. The M2 pooled fractions (volume made up to 1 mL with 0.1% Digitonin - TBS buffer) were next incubated overnight at 4°C under agitation with 200 µL of anti-V5 affinity resin beads (Sigma-Aldrich), pre-equilibrated in 0.1% digitonin-TBS buffer. The beads were washed 3 times in the same buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted for 1 h at 4°C with 0.4 mL of this buffer containing 500 µg/mL of V5 peptides (Sigma-Aldrich). This elution step was repeated 4 times, and the eluted fractions were pooled and designated “V5 pooled 1.6 mL fractions”. 6) Anti-HA affinity purification. As a final purification step, the V5 pooled fractions (volume made up to 1.8 mL with 0.1% digitonin - TBS buffer) were next incubated overnight at 4°C under agitation with 200 µL of anti-HA affinity resin beads (Sigma-Aldrich), pre-equilibrated in 0.1% digitonin - TBS buffer. The beads were washed 3 times in the same buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted overnight at 4°C with 0.2 mL of this buffer containing 200 µg/mL of HA peptides (Sigma-Aldrich). This elution step was repeated once, for 1 h at 4°C, and the two eluted fractions were kept separately, designated “HA fraction E1” and “HA fraction E2”.Co-immunoprecipitationCo-IPs were performed on microsomal protein extracts. Briefly, 100 µg of proteins were diluted in a final volume of 1 mL of 1% CHAPSO - HEPES extraction buffer containing protease inhibitors (Roche), and 50 µL of pre-equilibrated anti-Flag or anti-HA affinity beads (Sigma-Aldrich) were added. Samples were next incubated overnight at 4°C on a rotator wheel and were washed three times in 0.2% CHAPSO - HEPES buffer. Finally, beads were resuspended in 50 µL of 0.2% CHAPSO - HEPES buffer and were used for in vitro γ-secretase assays.In vitro γ-secretase activity assaysIn vitro γ-secretase activity assays were performed as previously described [27]. γ-Secretase APP-based substrates were expressed in E. coli transfected with plasmids pET21-C100-Flag or pET21-C100-His as a fusion protein consisting of a Met for translation initiation, and either the Flag tag sequence (C100-Flag) or the His tag sequence (C100-His), and were affinity purified using an anti-Flag resin (M2, Sigma-Aldrich) or an Ni-NTA agarose resin (Invitrogen), respectively. In vitro assays were performed at 37°C for 4 h, with 1 µM of recombinant substrate, 0.025% phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and 0.1% phosphatidylcholine (PC). γ-Secretase activity was quantified by measuring the amount of AICD and Aβ generated during the reaction, by immunoblot or sandwich ELISA respectively, as described below.SDS-PAGE, Native PAGE, Western blotting and antibodiesTotal or microsomal protein extracts were resolved by electrophoresis on NuPAGE® Novex® 4–12% Bis-Tris Gels (Invitrogen) or on standard 12% acrylamide/bisacrylamide Tris Glycine gels for SDS-PAGE analysis. Purified γ-secretase was resolved by electrophoresis on NativePAGE™ Novex® Bis-Tris 4–16% Gels for Blue Native (BN)-PAGE analysis (Invitrogen). Silver staining was performed directly on gel according to manufacturer instructions (Biorad). For immunoblot analysis, gels were transferred to nitrocellulose or PVDF membranes (Whatman), and probed with the following antibodies: anti-Nicastrin NCT164 (BD Bioscience), anti-V5-tag for NCT-V5 (Covance), MAB1563 (Millipore) or ab10281 (Abcam) for PS1 NTF, MAB5232 for PS1 CTF (Millipore), 3F10 for APH1aL-HA (Roche), anti-Flag M2 for Flag-PEN-2 or C100-Flag (Sigma-Aldrich), A8717 for APP CTF (Sigma-Aldrich), and A2066 for β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich). Anti-mouse/rabbit/rat IgG conjugated to Alexa 680 were purchased from Invitrogen. The Odyssey infrared imaging system (LICOR) was used to detect the fluorescent signal.Quantification of Aβ peptidesAβ peptides from the γ-secretase assays described above were quantified by sandwich ELISA according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Three kits were used to detect human Aβ1–40 (Invitrogen KHB3481) and Aβ1–42 (Invitrogen KHB3544 and Wako 269-64401).Supporting Information Top Figure S1. Characterization of stable cell lines overexpressing human FAD-linked PS1 variants in MEF PS1/2−/−. Presenilin double-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts were stably transduced with lentiviral vectors carrying genes encoding hPS1 variants harbouring FAD-linked mutations or mutations in the catalytic aspartate residue(s), or PS1-WT, and cloned. Two clones per PS1 variant were selected for characterization. (A) Whole cell protein extracts of the different cell lines were prepared in 1% NP40-HEPES buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining with various antibodies to detect the endogenous γ-secretase core components: NCT (NCT164), hPS1 (NTF, MAB1563), and PEN2 (UD1), and with an antibody for APP (A8717). β-Actin was used as a loading control. Each lane represents one selected clone. (B) γ-Secretase activity assays were performed with microsomal extracts prepared in 1% CHAPSO-HEPES buffer. Equal protein levels from the different extracts were diluted to 0.25% CHAPSO-HEPES buffer and incubated for 4 h at 37°C with lipids and 1 µM of recombinant human APP-based substrate (C100-Flag). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunostained with anti-Flag (M2) or anti-PS1 (MAB1563). PS1 immunostaining was used to assess the amount of input material. * Indicates a non-specific band, which was not detected in microsomal protein extracts of the same cell lines using the same antibody (MAB1563) (B). CTF: C-terminal fragment, FL: full-length, im.: immature NCT; m.: mature NCT, N: N-glycosylated, NTF: N-terminal fragment, O: O-glycosylated.(TIF)Figure S2. APP-CTF profiles in WT MEF, MEF PS1/2−/− and γ - PS1/2 transduced with the SPA4CT construct. WT MEF, MEF PS1/2−/− and γ - PS1/2 were transduced with an APP-based substrate corresponding to the 99 C-terminal residues of human APP fused to the APP signal peptide in N-terminus (SPA4CT [36]). Cell proteins were extracted in 1% NP40-HEPES buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining with an antibody targeting the C-terminal part of APP (A8717).(TIF)Figure S3. APH1 isoforms expressed in MEF PS1/2−/−. Total RNAs were extracted from presenilin double-knockout MEFs, using standard procedures (Qiagen RNAeasy kit) and were quantified by spectrophotometry. One microgram of total RNAs was reverse transcribed for 1 h at 42°C by using the ImProm-II reverse transcription system (Promega) and oligo-dT primer in a final volume of 20 µL. PCR was next performed for each APH1 isoform on 1 µL of RT reaction by using the Roche PCR kit under standard conditions and the primers described in Table S1. The following cycling conditions were applied for all reactions: 94°C, 3 min; 30 cycles of [94°C, 30 s; 58°C, 30 s; 70°C, 40 s]; 70°C, 10 min. PCR products were separated on a 2% agarose gel and visualized using Alpha Innotech UV imager.(TIF)Table S1. Primers used to detect APH1 isoforms in MEF PS1/2−/−.
