Question: Which technique was used to determine the cellular locations of the CLU1 and CLU2 gene products?
101*********************
0.22934115	Within B, the value in parentheses following the tissue name is the CLU1:CLU2 ratio.
138*********************
0.20805179	Importantly, this 5.1 kDa size difference between endogenous and transfected clusterin is similar to the size difference between the CLU1 and CLU2-predicted proteins, indicating that if the proteins encoded by CLU1 and CLU2 differed by 5 kDa, the proteins would be resolved easily under these experimental conditions.
166*********************
0.03591841	The most parsimonious interpretation of these data is that CLU1 translation is generally initiated at the common exon 2 ATG.
167*********************
0.034235876	The possibility exists that a portion of CLU1 translation is initiated at the exon 1a ATG at levels too low to be readily detected or that produce an unstable protein which is rapidly degraded.
179*********************
0.034235876	Moreover, variability in these factors could facilitate or obscure the SNP association with CLU1 expression described here, suggesting that replication of these data in additional samples is necessary for their acceptance by the research community.
109*********************
0.03263999	Since the minor rs11136000T allele was associated with both increased CLU1 expression and reduced AD risk [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], we interpret these results as suggesting that increased CLU1 expression is associated with reduced AD risk.
23*********************
0.031346813	Quantitative expression studies show that both CLU1 and CLU2 are increased in AD but only CLU1 is associated with rs11136000.
145*********************
0.031346813	Second, the expression of only CLU1 was associated with rs11136000 while both CLU1 and CLU2 were increased with robust AD neuropathology.
87*********************
0.03104291	The predicted protein sequences encoded by CLU1 and CLU2, beginning with the initial ATG sites shown in A, are shown in panel C. The sequence in gray font is unique to CLU1 while sequence in black font is common to CLU1 and CLU2.
108*********************
0.030651366	However, only CLU1 expression was associated with rs11136000.
=========================================================
========================================================
Question: What compartments inside the cell contain clusterin proteins?
136*********************
1.4427694	g004 To evaluate whether the clusterin proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 in vitro are similar to those produced in vivo, we compared ectopic clusterin with endogenous clusterin in SH-SY5Y cells and in human brain by Western blotting with a clusterin antibody.
128*********************
1.2262615	CLU1 and CLU2 produce clusterin proteins that are similar to each other and to clusterin in human brain.
146*********************
1.186316	Third, CLU1 and CLU2 produce secreted clusterin proteins that are similar to each other and to clusterin in human brain.
135*********************
0.9960511	Overall, the cellular clusterin proteins are similar in size to the human brain clusterin, as discerned for the intact and cleaved clusterin under reducing conditions (D) or as the heterodimeric clusterin under non-reducing conditions (E).
133*********************
0.89093226	When transfected and endogenous clusterin proteins were detected with an antibody raised against a carboxyl-terminal clusterin epitope (D‚ÄìE), intact clusterin from transfection (T-labeled arrow) was slightly larger than endogenous clusterin (E-labeled arrow), reflecting the ~5.1 kDa V5 epitope and His tags in the ectopic clusterin (D).
165*********************
0.75090355	Comparable results were obtained in two cell types, suggesting that CLU1 and CLU2 generally produce soluble clusterin protein.
122*********************
0.70500004	Cell lysates contained both intact and cleaved clusterin while conditioned medium contained only cleaved clusterin; the clusterin protein produced by CLU1 and CLU2 appeared equal in size (Figure 4A).
182*********************
0.48074266	Both CLU1 and CLU2 produce a soluble, secreted clusterin protein that is similar to that observed in human brain.
153*********************
0.41066343	We note that the lack of an association between total CLU and rs11136000 was similar to prior reports that total CLU mRNA or clusterin protein were not associated with rs11136000 [17], [34].
16*********************
0.3574027	Although the primary role of clusterin in AD is unclear, CLU is implicated in AD by several lines of evidence, including (I) CLU mRNA and clusterin protein is increased in AD [5], [6], (ii) clusterin is a component of plaques [4], [5], [7], (iii) clusterin modulates AD-related pathways such as inflammation and apoptosis [1], [8], [9] and (iv) clusterin acts as an amyloid-beta (A√ü) chaperone to alter A√ü aggregation and/or clearance ([10], [11], reviewed in [4], [12], [13], [14]).

19*********************
0.48433673	Two CLU isoforms, CLU1 and CLU2, have been reported that consist of nine exons and differ only in their first exons and associated proximal promoters; CLU1 is predicted to encode a nuclear proteinand CLU2 a secreted protein (reviewed in [20]).
97*********************

1*********************
0.087466374	Abstract Top The minor allele of rs11136000 within CLU is strongly associated with reduced Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk.
171*********************
0.03225123	Furthermore, since CLU expression is increased in AD without reversing the disease, we speculate that enhanced CLU expression reduces AD risk only if CLU expression is increased well before AD onset, mimicking the likely SNP effects.
191*********************
0.027145153	The National Institute on Aging, and Reagan Institute Working Group on Diagnostic Criteria for the Neuropathological Assessment of Alzheimer's Disease.
148*********************
0.014627684	Overall, these results identify a possible means underlying the association of rs11136000 with AD risk.
147*********************
0.013791112	Since CLU is increased in AD and CLU1 is increased with the minor rs11136000T allele, which is also associated with reduced AD risk, we interpret our results as suggesting that increased CLU expression throughout life may reduce AD risk.
170*********************
0.013791112	A logical extension of the finding that AD risk is reduced with a genetic variant that correlates with increased CLU expression is that other factors that increase CLU expression may also reduce AD risk.

Question: Which entity does allosterically regulate insulin degrading enzyme activity?
107*********************
0.09826862	It is known that a small fraction of IDE (ranging from 3% to 10%) is secreted into the extracellular space, where it presumably interacts with its substrates, such as insulin and Œ≤-amyloid [8], [38].
18*********************
0.043429006	Notably, IDE is a zinc metalloendopeptidase that hydrolyzes a wide range of substrates, including insulin, amylin, glucagon, atrial natriuretic factor and insulin-like growth factors I and II [8].
2*********************
0.04299252	Insulin-degrading-enzyme (IDE) is one of the main extracellular protease targeting AŒ≤, and thus it represents an interesting pharmacological target for AD therapy.
35*********************
0.03685073	Human somatostatin was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA); recombinant insulin degrading-enzyme was purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA, USA); Œ≤-amyloid (1‚Äì40) was obtained from Anaspec (San Jose, CA, USA).
16*********************
0.030708943	Several proteases, such as insulin-degrading-enzyme (IDE), neprilysin (NEP) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) are involved in AŒ≤ degradation [4]‚Äì[6].

Question: Which peptide hormone is the positive transcriptional regulator of IDE?
142*********************
0.104461215	Somatostatin regulates IDE activity enhancing IDE-dependent AŒ≤ degradation.
89*********************
0.095279366	This addition further amplifies the positive modulation of IDE expression (Figure 1).
93*********************
0.095279366	Somatostatin induces an increase of IDE expression in microglia cells.
136*********************
0.095279366	To this purpose, IDE expression was silenced through a siRNA-based approach.
92*********************
0.09401162	IDE level was analyzed by Western blotting in cell lysates collected after 24 hrs of sst incubation and as indicated in Figure S1, no detectable modulation of IDE expression was observed.
172*********************
0.09401162	The lack of similar evidence in supernatants from IDE-silenced cells suggests that the decrease in AŒ≤ levels is fully attributable to the modulation of IDE activity secreted before sst administration.
98*********************
0.09158488	The sst-mediated up-regulation of IDE in BV-2 cells was further checked by quantifying the mRNA using a Real
168*********************
0.09158488	Therefore, this evidence might explain the discrepancy between sst and its analogue concerning the positive modulation of IDE expression, even though additional factors cannot be ruled out.
108*********************
0.08789039	In order to determine whether, besides inducing synthesis, sst also stimulates IDE secretion, the enzyme concentration in cell supernatants was quantified 24 hrs after sst administration.
109*********************
0.08789039	As reported in Figure 2B, the neuropeptide induces the increase of IDE secretion in a similar way to WB and RT-PCR (Figue 1B and 2A).
=========================================================
========================================================
Question: In which cell line was the gene expression regulation of IDE characterized?
90*********************
0.34816736	It is interesting to note that WB analysis on cell lysates of sst-stimulated N9 microglia cell line confirms the enhancing effect on IDE expression (data not shown).
175*********************
0.23504512	Therefore, a correlation can be envisaged between the regulation of IDE activity and the microglial immunological function during the development of AD, opening a new therapeutic scenario for the control of AD in the early phases.
41*********************
0.18953359	BV-2, a murine microglial cell line, was cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS), L-glutammine (2 mM), penicillin (50 IU/ml), streptomycin (50 ¬µg/ml), sodium pyruvate (1 mM) and ciprofloxacin (0.03 mM).
24*********************
0.10894718	Somatostatin seems to be also involved in the regulation of neprilysin activity by affecting its expression and its synaptic localization [22].

Question: What regulates the production of neprilysin?
111*********************
1.3615968	In addition to their ability to phagocyte Œ≤-amyloid, microglia can also clear AŒ≤ by degradation through the production of AŒ≤-degrading enzymes, such as IDE, neprilysin and MMP-9 [29], [33], [39].
24*********************
0.11730319	Somatostatin seems to be also involved in the regulation of neprilysin activity by affecting its expression and its synaptic localization [22].
16*********************
0.08211224	Several proteases, such as insulin-degrading-enzyme (IDE), neprilysin (NEP) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) are involved in AŒ≤ degradation [4]‚Äì[6].

Question: What is the major protease produced by microglia responsible for degrading A?
151*********************
0.14302029	Notably, IDE is the main extracellular protease secreted by microglia involved in AŒ≤ degradation, even though the molecular basis of IDE regulation are poorly known [5].
157*********************
0.14302029	In this work, we further study the effect of sst on IDE showing that the neuropeptide somatostatin also specifically regulates IDE, the main extracellular AŒ≤ protease, by affecting its expression and secretion in both primary and BV-2 microglia cells.

0.7762306	Interestingly, we also observed that in astrocytes, incubation with somatostatin does not have any significant detectable effect of IDE expression, reinforcing the physiological relevance of somatostatin action on IDE secretion in microglia cells.
159*********************
0.58717775	Through this pathway, somatostatin enhances IDE secretion, strengthening the pool of active enzymes which interact with Œ≤-amyloid and other IDE extracellular substrates.
108*********************
0.4051913	In order to determine whether, besides inducing synthesis, sst also stimulates IDE secretion, the enzyme concentration in cell supernatants was quantified 24 hrs after sst administration.
109*********************
0.4051913	As reported in Figure 2B, the neuropeptide induces the increase of IDE secretion in a similar way to WB and RT-PCR (Figue 1B and 2A).
127*********************
0.4051913	A similar result can also be obtained for IDE secretion, by using an ELISA assay on BV-2 cell supernatants collected 24 hrs after the administration (Figure 4B).
4*********************
0.3534009	A similar effect can also be observed when adding octreotide.
99*********************
0.22058216	A time-course investigation reveals that IDE mRNA increases linearly with the sst concentration within 5 hrs to incubation and turns back after 24 hrs, suggesting a transcriptional effect triggered by sst in BV2 cells (Figure 2A).
=========================================================
========================================================
Question: What are the sst receptors that are expressed on rat astrocytes?
91*********************
1.5737218	In order to assess whether the effect of sst on IDE expression is a microglia characteristic, rat astrocytes which display three sst receptor subtypes as well (SSTR-1, SSTR-2, and SSTR-4) [37] were incubated with the same somatostatin concentrations (Figure S1).
178*********************
0.14824682	Rat Astrocytes were incubated with indicated concentrations of somatostatin.
=========================================================
========================================================
Question: What method was used to inhibit the expression of IDE?
89*********************
0.24299735	This addition further amplifies the positive modulation of IDE expression (Figure 1).
93*********************
0.24299735	Somatostatin induces an increase of IDE expression in microglia cells.
136*********************
0.24299735	To this purpose, IDE expression was silenced through a siRNA-based approach.
168*********************
0.22785436	Therefore, this evidence might explain the discrepancy between sst and its analogue concerning the positive modulation of IDE expression, even though additional factors cannot be ruled out.
92*********************
0.225449	IDE level was analyzed by Western blotting in cell lysates collected after 24 hrs of sst incubation and as indicated in Figure S1, no detectable modulation of IDE expression was observed.
177*********************
0.21623108	Modulation of IDE expression by somatostatin.
128*********************
0.21271135	Therefore, these findings indicate that octreotide and sst exert a very similar effect on IDE expression and secretion in BV-2 cells (see Figures 1, 2 and 4).
162*********************
0.21271135	It is thus conceivable that sst depletion results in a decrease of IDE expression and secretion contributing to the pathological deposition of Œ≤-amyloid in the brain.
179*********************
0.21271135	Western blot analysis of normalized lysis samples indicates that no detectable effect of IDE expression is observed (left panel).

Question: What effect can be observed when when Œ≥-secretase is blocked? 
73*********************
0.46663827	These data suggest that the effect of FAD mutations in PS1 on APP-CTFs accumulation was similar in presence or absence of other human components of the Œ≥-secretase.
199*********************
0.427522	They found decreased self-renewal and differentiation of neuronal precursor cells in the subventricular zone, suggesting that the loss-of-function phenotype of PSEN1 mutations can also be observed in heterogeneous conditions.
193*********************
0.35598937	These include TMP21 or the recently reported Œ≥-secretase activating protein (GSAP) [12], [13].
26*********************
0.3353122	In addition, PS1 has been shown to interact with a growing list of proteins that modulate Œ≥-secretase activity [9], [12], [13], [14].
78*********************
0.33092326	As estimated by ELISA, a three-fold increase in AŒ≤1‚Äì40 and AŒ≤1‚Äì42 levels was observed in the cell culture media of cell lines overexpressing human Œ≥-secretase (Œ≥-MEF WT), in comparison to untransduced WT MEFs (Figure 2B).
263*********************
0.3301429	Purified Œ≥-secretase was resolved by electrophoresis on NativePAGE‚Ñ¢ Novex¬Æ Bis-Tris 4‚Äì16% Gels for Blue Native (BN)-PAGE analysis (Invitrogen).
24*********************
0.32392192	The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is processed by the successive actions of Œ≤-secretase (BACE1) and Œ≥-secretase, generating amyloid-beta peptides (AŒ≤) of different lengths, ranging from 37 to 46 amino acids [10].
150*********************
0.3234488	g005 Discussion Top Several conflicting results as to how Alzheimer's disease-linked mutations in PSEN1 affect the processing of APP by Œ≥-secretase have been reported.
68*********************
0.32245132	As expected, and as indicated by increased levels of intracellular APP-CTFs (a common characteristic among known substrates in response to Œ≥-secretase pharmacological inhibition), the activity of Œ≥-secretase was significantly altered in the PS deficient parental Œ≥ - PS1/2 cell line as well as in all clones expressing dominant negative forms of PS1 (Figure 1B).
181*********************
0.3198043	Interestingly, the same study also reported that P436Q variant showed a decreased Œ≥-secretase activity and AŒ≤40 and AŒ≤42 secretion in PS1/PS2 double knockout cells (~75% or ~50% of the control for AŒ≤40 or AŒ≤42, respectively), but to a lesser extent than what we measured in this study (more than 97% for both AŒ≤ species).

Question: When APH1 genes are overexpressed in MEF KO what happens with the AŒ≤?
160*********************
1.0194504	When compared to APH1aS or L, overexpression of APH1b in MEF knockout for all APH1 genes led to increased production of longer AŒ≤ species [24].
157*********************
0.5565545	Indeed, Œ≥-secretase complexes are heterogeneous in composition due to the existence of two human APH1 genes, APH1a and APH1b, and two splicing isoforms of APH1a (S and L), as well as two presenilin genes, PSEN1 and PSEN2.
114*********************
0.3626716	However, in the latter, the ratio may have been overestimated because the AŒ≤1‚Äì40 levels measured were at the detection limit.
103*********************
0.12599304	(C) AŒ≤1‚Äì40 and AŒ≤1‚Äì42 were quantified by sandwich ELISA and represented in pg/mL (left Y-axis) or in percentage (right Y-axis) of the mean of AŒ≤1‚Äì40 levels generated by the two wild-type clones.
80*********************
0.106733635	First, only traces of both AŒ≤1‚Äì40 and AŒ≤1‚Äì42 were detected in Œ≥-MEFs overexpressing PS1 with aspartate mutants.
113*********************
0.106733635	Interestingly, an overall AŒ≤1‚Äì42/AŒ≤1‚Äì40 ratio of ~1 was estimated for all PS1 mutants, with the exception of P436Q#4 (~2).
128*********************
0.106733635	Next, sandwich ELISAs directed against AŒ≤1‚Äì40 and AŒ≤1‚Äì42 were performed in order to further characterize the specific activity of the purified complexes.
168*********************
0.106733635	In contrast, Bentahir and colleagues found that PS1-L166P decreased both AŒ≤1‚Äì40 and AŒ≤1‚Äì42 production in a PS knockout background.
169*********************
0.106733635	These results are consistent with our in vitro data, although the reduction in AŒ≤1‚Äì42 and AŒ≤1‚Äì40 production was more pronounced in our system.
170*********************
0.106733635	However, they differ from our cell-based data in which we observed an increase in AŒ≤1‚Äì42 associated with a decrease in AŒ≤1‚Äì40.

Question: What experimental technique was used specifically to purify the Œ≥-secretase complex?
21*********************
2.144875	PS1 and PS2 play fundamental roles in cell signalling as part of the Œ≥-secretase complex.
43*********************
1.9272134	Our global strategy consisted in producing stable cell lines, on a PS1/2‚àí/‚àí background, that overexpress tagged versions of the three human Œ≥-secretase subunits NCT, APH1 and PEN2 together with different variants of human PS1, and to purify the different human Œ≥-secretase complexes by three sequential affinity purification steps.
3*********************
1.0217923	Together with nicastrin (NCT), anterior pharynx-defective protein 1 (APH1), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2), the catalytic subunit PS1 constitutes the core of the Œ≥-secretase complex and contributes to the proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) into amyloid-beta (AŒ≤) peptides.
108*********************
0.8614772	As shown in Figure 3B, the anti-Flag and anti-HA resins immunoprecipitated similar levels of NCT, PS1 and PEN2 and the activity of the Œ≥-secretase complexes was similar regardless of the affinity resins used (Figures 3B).
8*********************
0.7776285	A multi-step affinity purification procedure was used to isolate semi-purified or highly purified Œ≥-secretase complexes.
122*********************
0.67193186	As the main goal of this experiment was to compare the efficacy of the different Œ≥-secretase complexes to process APP-based substrates, it is important to note that the final yields of the complexes purified from the different clones were very similar (Figure 4B), thus facilitating further comparative analyses.
178*********************
0.5169269	In the present study, AŒ≤1‚Äì40, AŒ≤1‚Äì42, as well as AICD levels generated from purified Œ≥-secretase complexes with PS1-ŒîE9 were close to the limit of detection, resulting in a loss of at least 95% of the Œ≥-secretase activity compared to wild-type PS1.
238*********************

1.2183667	Supporting this view, the Œ≥-secretase inhibitor Semagacestat tested in phase III clinical trials not only failed to slow cognitive decline in patients with mild-to-moderate AD, but actually made it worse [59].
73*********************
0.51342386	These data suggest that the effect of FAD mutations in PS1 on APP-CTFs accumulation was similar in presence or absence of other human components of the Œ≥-secretase.
68*********************
0.5126559	As expected, and as indicated by increased levels of intracellular APP-CTFs (a common characteristic among known substrates in response to Œ≥-secretase pharmacological inhibition), the activity of Œ≥-secretase was significantly altered in the PS deficient parental Œ≥ - PS1/2 cell line as well as in all clones expressing dominant negative forms of PS1 (Figure 1B).
273*********************
0.46224484	(A) Whole cell protein extracts of the different cell lines were prepared in 1% NP40-HEPES buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining with various antibodies to detect the endogenous Œ≥-secretase core components: NCT (NCT164), hPS1 (NTF, MAB1563), and PEN2 (UD1), and with an antibody for APP (A8717).
133*********************
0.33442637	(A) Schematic representation of the Œ≥-secretase purification process.
43*********************
0.3082485	Our global strategy consisted in producing stable cell lines, on a PS1/2‚àí/‚àí background, that overexpress tagged versions of the three human Œ≥-secretase subunits NCT, APH1 and PEN2 together with different variants of human PS1, and to purify the different human Œ≥-secretase complexes by three sequential affinity purification steps.
26*********************
0.3028683	In addition, PS1 has been shown to interact with a growing list of proteins that modulate Œ≥-secretase activity [9], [12], [13], [14].
78*********************
0.30016503	As estimated by ELISA, a three-fold increase in AŒ≤1‚Äì40 and AŒ≤1‚Äì42 levels was observed in the cell culture media of cell lines overexpressing human Œ≥-secretase (Œ≥-MEF WT), in comparison to untransduced WT MEFs (Figure 2B).
263*********************
0.29968438	Purified Œ≥-secretase was resolved by electrophoresis on NativePAGE‚Ñ¢ Novex¬Æ Bis-Tris 4‚Äì16% Gels for Blue Native (BN)-PAGE analysis (Invitrogen).
23*********************
0.28393126	For some substrates like NOTCH1 or ERBB4, the Œ≥-secretase cleavage is essential for their biological function, whereas for other substrates like DCC or NEUREXIN-3Œ≤ [8], the possible role of the cleavage in signalling events has not been formally established (see [9] for a review).

Question: What mutation of the PS1 protein causes Œ≥-secretase activity almost to disappear?
26*********************
0.46365553	In addition, PS1 has been shown to interact with a growing list of proteins that modulate Œ≥-secretase activity [9], [12], [13], [14].
193*********************
0.30076715	These include TMP21 or the recently reported Œ≥-secretase activating protein (GSAP) [12], [13].
19*********************
0.2950492	Active Œ≥-secretase is a multiprotein complex composed of PS1 or PS2 together with nicastrin (NCT), the anterior pharynx-defective protein 1 (APH1), and the presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2).
110*********************
0.2950492	Furthermore, levels of AŒ≤1‚Äì40 produced from PS1-L166P, PS1-ŒîE9 and P436Q variants fell respectively to ~6%, ~1.5% and ~0.5%, when compared to these produced from PS1-WT Œ≥-secretase.
263*********************
0.2950492	Purified Œ≥-secretase was resolved by electrophoresis on NativePAGE‚Ñ¢ Novex¬Æ Bis-Tris 4‚Äì16% Gels for Blue Native (BN)-PAGE analysis (Invitrogen).
25*********************
0.29390562	Cleavage of the APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs) by Œ≥-secretase also releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD), which has been recently involved in the regulation of brain ApoE expression, a major genetic determinant of AD, and in cholesterol metabolism [11].
181*********************
0.15569054	Interestingly, the same study also reported that P436Q variant showed a decreased Œ≥-secretase activity and AŒ≤40 and AŒ≤42 secretion in PS1/PS2 double knockout cells (~75% or ~50% of the control for AŒ≤40 or AŒ≤42, respectively), but to a lesser extent than what we measured in this study (more than 97% for both AŒ≤ species).
259*********************
0.14723483	In vitro Œ≥-secretase activity assays were performed as previously described [27].
73*********************
0.14629683	These data suggest that the effect of FAD mutations in PS1 on APP-CTFs accumulation was similar in presence or absence of other human components of the Œ≥-secretase.

Question: How many mutations relevant for familial forms of Alzheimer's disease have been detected for the PSEN1 gene?
2*********************
1.3889395	Mutations linked to early onset, familial forms of Alzheimer's disease (FAD) are found most frequently in PSEN1, the gene encoding presenilin-1 (PS1).
205*********************
0.15712881	This deleterious dual effect might explain why FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations cause early onset Alzheimer's disease.
17*********************
0.15181117	Introduction Top Since their discovery in 1995 and their association with early onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) [1], [2], the presenilin genes PSEN1 and PSEN2 have been widely studied, and the complexity of their biological role is becoming increasingly evident.
10*********************
0.14649352	Our data support the view that PS1 mutations lead to a strong Œ≥-secretase loss-of-function phenotype and an increased AŒ≤1‚Äì42/AŒ≤1‚Äì40 ratio, two mechanisms that are potentially involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.

0.003329626	Next, the clone expressing the highest levels of all three recombinant proteins was selected (designated Œ≥ - PS1/2) and used as the parental cell line that was further transduced with lentivectors carrying the following different human PS1 variants: PS1-WT, three dominant-negative forms of PS1 that lack the crucial, catalytic site aspartate residues (D257A, D385A, and both D257A/D385A referred to as DDAA later in the article), and three FAD-linked PS1 mutants (L166P, ŒîE9 and P436Q, with mean disease onset at 24 years, 45.5 years and 28.3 years, respectively).
