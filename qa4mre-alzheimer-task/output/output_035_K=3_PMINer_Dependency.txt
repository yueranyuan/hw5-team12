Question: Which technique was used to determine the cellular locations of the CLU1 and CLU2 gene products?
0.17876425	Within B, the value in parentheses following the tissue name is the CLU1:CLU2 ratio.
0.17876425	The most parsimonious interpretation of these data is that CLU1 translation is generally initiated at the common exon 2 ATG.
0.170391	The possibility exists that a portion of CLU1 translation is initiated at the exon 1a ATG at levels too low to be readily detected or that produce an unstable protein which is rapidly degraded.
0.170391	Moreover, variability in these factors could facilitate or obscure the SNP association with CLU1 expression described here, suggesting that replication of these data in additional samples is necessary for their acceptance by the research community.
0.16244735	Since the minor rs11136000T allele was associated with both increased CLU1 expression and reduced AD risk [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], we interpret these results as suggesting that increased CLU1 expression is associated with reduced AD risk.
0.15600936	Quantitative expression studies show that both CLU1 and CLU2 are increased in AD but only CLU1 is associated with rs11136000.
0.15600936	Second, the expression of only CLU1 was associated with rs11136000 while both CLU1 and CLU2 were increased with robust AD neuropathology.
0.15449765	The predicted protein sequences encoded by CLU1 and CLU2, beginning with the initial ATG sites shown in A, are shown in panel C. The sequence in gray font is unique to CLU1 while sequence in black font is common to CLU1 and CLU2.
0.1525473	However, only CLU1 expression was associated with rs11136000.
0.1525473	Hence, CLU1 and CLU2 produce similar secreted proteins in vitro.
=========================================================
========================================================
Question: What compartments inside the cell contain clusterin proteins?
3.1665473	Comparable results were obtained in two cell types, suggesting that CLU1 and CLU2 generally produce soluble clusterin protein.
2.9723077	Cell lysates contained both intact and cleaved clusterin while conditioned medium contained only cleaved clusterin; the clusterin protein produced by CLU1 and CLU2 appeared equal in size (Figure 4A).
2.600769	g004 To evaluate whether the clusterin proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 in vitro are similar to those produced in vivo, we compared ectopic clusterin with endogenous clusterin in SH-SY5Y cells and in human brain by Western blotting with a clusterin antibody.
2.1390443	CLU1 and CLU2 produce clusterin proteins that are similar to each other and to clusterin in human brain.
2.0264645	Third, CLU1 and CLU2 produce secreted clusterin proteins that are similar to each other and to clusterin in human brain.
2.0264645	Both CLU1 and CLU2 produce a soluble, secreted clusterin protein that is similar to that observed in human brain.
1.730939	We note that the lack of an association between total CLU and rs11136000 was similar to prior reports that total CLU mRNA or clusterin protein were not associated with rs11136000 [17], [34].
1.5057794	Although the primary role of clusterin in AD is unclear, CLU is implicated in AD by several lines of evidence, including (I) CLU mRNA and clusterin protein is increased in AD [5], [6], (ii) clusterin is a component of plaques [4], [5], [7], (iii) clusterin modulates AD-related pathways such as inflammation and apoptosis [1], [8], [9] and (iv) clusterin acts as an amyloid-beta (Aß) chaperone to alter Aß aggregation and/or clearance ([10], [11], reviewed in [4], [12], [13], [14]).
1.4917035	Overall, the cellular clusterin proteins are similar in size to the human brain clusterin, as discerned for the intact and cleaved clusterin under reducing conditions (D) or as the heterodimeric clusterin under non-reducing conditions (E).
1.4917035	Overall, we summarize our current results by noting that the proteins produced from CLU1 and CLU2 in vitro are similar to each other, and similar in size to those present in human brain, leading us to interpret our data as supporting the possibility that CLU1 and CLU2 generally produce secreted clusterin protein in vitro and in vivo.

Question: Which of the two CLU isoforms is the main one expressed in the choroid plexus?
2.1085484	Discerning the association between rs11136000 and CLU1 depended upon analyzing these two CLU isoforms separately.
1.8988339	In summary, the association between rs11136000 and CLU1 was dependent upon analyzing the two CLU isoforms separately.
1.5341365	To gain further insights into CLU isoform expression, we quantified CLU1 and CLU2 in a series of single human fetal tissue samples as well as a set of six adult choroid plexus samples (Figure 2B).
1.3716967	Two CLU isoforms, CLU1 and CLU2, have been reported that consist of nine exons and differ only in their first exons and associated proximal promoters; CLU1 is predicted to encode a nuclear protein and CLU2a secreted protein (reviewed in [20]).
0.6012256	Additional reported isoforms include a CLU isoform that lacks exon 5 and a CLU isoform that lacks exon two, which encodes the leader sequence, resulting in another nuclear clusterin [21], [22].
0.53141344	Here, we investigated the hypothesis that CLU isoforms are differentially modulated by AD status and AD-associated SNPs.
0.53141344	Results Top To begin to evaluate CLU expression, we screened human brain cDNA to identify CLU isoforms present in brain.
0.53141344	The CLU isoforms were quantified in separate real-time PCR assays that used forward primers corresponding to their unique exon 1 and a common reverse primer that targeted the exon 2–3 boundary.
0.53141344	Expression of CLU isoforms in human tissues.
0.53141344	One possible modulator of interest is age-dependent changes in sex hormones since CLU isoforms are differentially regulated by androgens [35].

Question: Which clusterin single nucleotide polymorphism has been linked to a reduction in the risk for developing Alzheimer's disease?
0.49438256	Abstract Top The minor allele of rs11136000 within CLU is strongly associated with reduced Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk.
0.22859883	Introduction Top Clusterin (CLU, APOJ) has been implicated in diseases ranging from cancer to Alzheimer's disease (AD) (reviewed in [1], [2], [3], [4]).
0.19196478	Find this article online (1997) Consensus recommendations for the postmortem diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.
0.18085285	Furthermore, since CLU expression is increased in AD without reversing the disease, we speculate that enhanced CLU expression reduces AD risk only if CLU expression is increased well before AD onset, mimicking the likely SNP effects.
0.15357183	The National Institute on Aging, and Reagan Institute Working Group on Diagnostic Criteria for the Neuropathological Assessment of Alzheimer's Disease.
0.09598239	Find this article online Aksenov MY, Tucker HM, Nair P, Aksenova MV, Butterfield DA, et al. (1999) The expression of several mitochondrial and nuclear genes encoding the subunits of electron transport chain enzyme complexes, cytochrome c oxidase, and NADH dehydrogenase, in different brain regions in Alzheimer's disease.
0.08257417	Overall, these results identify a possible means underlying the association of rs11136000 with AD risk.
0.07785167	Since CLU is increased in AD and CLU1 is increased with the minor rs11136000T allele, which is also associated with reduced AD risk, we interpret our results as suggesting that increased CLU expression throughout life may reduce AD risk.
0.07785167	A logical extension of the finding that AD risk is reduced with a genetic variant that correlates with increased CLU expression is that other factors that increase CLU expression may also reduce AD risk.

Question: Which CLU protein isoforms in the brain have been characterized?

0.10727811	We identified CLU1 and CLU2 as the major CLU isoforms in human brain.
0.10727811	CLU1 and CLU2 are the primary CLU isoforms expressed in human brain.
0.10727811	CLU1 and CLU2 produce clusterin proteins that are similar to each other and to clusterin in human brain.
0.101142764	Results Top To begin to evaluate CLU expression, we screened human brain cDNA to identify CLU isoforms present in brain.
0.08939843	In summary, CLU1 and CLU2 are the primary CLU isoforms in brain and are predicted to encode intracellular and secreted proteins, respectively.
0.08939843	Within A, each marker reflects the expression of CLU1 and CLU2, normalized to housekeeping genes, in a single brain sample.

0.08939843	Both CLU1 and CLU2 produce a soluble, secreted clusterin protein that is similar to that observed in human brain.
0.07151874	Lastly, although CLU1 and CLU2 are predicted to produce intracellular and secreted proteins, respectively, immunofluorescence and Western blot studies indicate that CLU1 and CLU2 both produce secreted proteins that are similar to those detected in the human brain.

Question: Which CLU isoform has a consistently higher gene expression?
2.8017185	Additional reported isoforms include a CLU isoform that lacks exon 5 and a CLU isoform that lacks exon two, which encodes the leader sequence, resulting in another nuclear clusterin [21], [22].

4.1865025	Expression of CLU isoforms in human tissues.
3.9656868	One possible modulator of interest is age-dependent changes in sex hormones since CLU isoforms are differentially regulated by androgens [35].
3.4586813	Results Top To begin to evaluate CLU expression, we screened human brain cDNA to identify CLU isoforms present in brain.
3.4462447	The association between CLU expression and rs11136000 was discerned because the CLU isoforms were analyzed separately.

2.8397274	Variation in CLU isoform expression were analyzed as a function of rs11136000 genotype, AD neuropathology, sex and age by using a general linear model (SPSS v.18 (IBM, Somers, NY)).
2.8397274	To gain further insights into CLU isoform expression, we quantified CLU1 and CLU2 in a series of single human fetal tissue samples as well as a set of six adult choroid plexus samples (Figure 2B).

Question: Which particular histone deacetylase inhibitor has been shown to enhance the expression of CLU? 
0.45770705	Furthermore, since CLU expression is increased in AD without reversing the disease, we speculate that enhanced CLU expression reduces AD risk only if CLU expression is increased well before AD onset, mimicking the likely SNP effects.
0.44054484	Identifying the unknown factors that account for the additional variance, which could include epigenetic factors, will facilitate understanding of CLU expression.
0.4230869	A logical extension of the finding that AD risk is reduced with a genetic variant that correlates with increased CLU expression is that other factors that increase CLU expression may also reduce AD risk.
0.4226721	For example, when we analyzed total CLU expression in the same fashion as reported here, total CLU was not associated with rs11136000 (p = 0.51) although a robust association with AD pathology was observed (p = 0.005, Ling et al., unpublished observations).
0.4180057	The association between CLU expression and rs11136000 was discerned because the CLU isoforms were analyzed separately.
0.41331384	While valproate may also act via other mechanisms [38], the actions of valproate on CLU expression may be relevant to its neuroprotection and merit further exploration to reduce AD risk.
0.3996983	Interestingly, one member of this class, valproate, increases CLU expression in human astrocytes [37] and reduces amyloid accumulation as well as behavioral deficits in mouse amyloid models [38], [39].
0.3808607	Expression of CLU isoforms in human tissues.
0.3254234	Results Top To begin to evaluate CLU expression, we screened human brain cDNA to identify CLU isoforms present in brain.
0.28737465	Since CLU is increased in AD and CLU1 is increased with the minor rs11136000T allele, which is also associated with reduced AD risk, we interpret our results as suggesting that increased CLU expression throughout life may reduce AD risk.

Question: Which entity does allosterically regulate insulin degrading enzyme activity?
0.5202193	It is known that a small fraction of IDE (ranging from 3% to 10%) is secreted into the extracellular space, where it presumably interacts with its substrates, such as insulin and ?-amyloid [8], [38].
0.22990662	Notably, IDE is a zinc metalloendopeptidase that hydrolyzes a wide range of substrates, including insulin, amylin, glucagon, atrial natriuretic factor and insulin-like growth factors I and II [8].
0.22759596	Insulin-degrading-enzyme (IDE) is one of the main extracellular protease targeting A?, and thus it represents an interesting pharmacological target for AD therapy.
0.19508223	Human somatostatin was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA); recombinant insulin degrading-enzyme was purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA, USA); ?-amyloid (1–40) was obtained from Anaspec (San Jose, CA, USA).
0.16256854	Several proteases, such as insulin-degrading-enzyme (IDE), neprilysin (NEP) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) are involved in A? degradation [4]–[6].

Question: Which peptide hormone is the positive transcriptional regulator of IDE?
Read: /Users/hbwang/Dropbox/cmu/sem3/11791-SE/hw5-team12/qa4mre-alzheimer-task/XMIs/12-test-alzheimer/QA4MRE-2012_BIOMEDICAL_GS.xml_4.xmi
0.44326192	Somatostatin regulates IDE activity enhancing IDE-dependent A? degradation.
0.40432492	This addition further amplifies the positive modulation of IDE expression (Figure 1).
0.40432492	Somatostatin induces an increase of IDE expression in microglia cells.
0.40432492	To this purpose, IDE expression was silenced through a siRNA-based approach.
0.39894885	IDE level was analyzed by Western blotting in cell lysates collected after 24 hrs of sst incubation and as indicated in Figure S1, no detectable modulation of IDE expression was observed.
0.39894885	The lack of similar evidence in supernatants from IDE-silenced cells suggests that the decrease in A? levels is fully attributable to the modulation of IDE activity secreted before sst administration.
0.38865787	The sst-mediated up-regulation of IDE in BV-2 cells was further checked by quantifying the mRNA using a Real
0.37299085	In order to determine whether, besides inducing synthesis, sst also stimulates IDE secretion, the enzyme concentration in cell supernatants was quantified 24 hrs after sst administration.
0.37299085	As reported in Figure 2B, the neuropeptide induces the increase of IDE secretion in a similar way to WB and RT-PCR (Figue 1B and 2A).
0.37299085	A similar result can also be obtained for IDE secretion, by using an ELISA assay on BV-2 cell supernatants collected 24 hrs after the administration (Figure 4B).
=========================================================
========================================================
Question: In which cell line was the gene expression regulation of IDE characterized?
0.6020055	It is interesting to note that WB analysis on cell lysates of sst-stimulated N9 microglia cell line confirms the enhancing effect on IDE expression (data not shown).
0.24054186	g001 Since there was no principle difference in the response to somatostatin in microglia cell lines compared to primary rat microglia, immortalized BV-2 cells were subsequently used.
0.15033866	BV-2, a murine microglial cell line, was cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS), L-glutammine (2 mM), penicillin (50 IU/ml), streptomycin (50 µg/ml), sodium pyruvate (1 mM) and ciprofloxacin (0.03 mM).
0.12825692	Somatostatin regulates IDE activity enhancing IDE-dependent A? degradation.
0.12092178	Modulation of IDE expression by somatostatin.
0.10688077	This result indicates that somatostatin acts not only by modulating IDE expression, but also by affecting IDE secretion and increasing the amount of the enzyme in the extracellular space.
0.10580656	g002 Somatostatin effect on IDE secretion
0.10580656	g003 Octreotide modulation of IDE expression
0.10580656	We previously demonstrated that sst is an allosteric modulator of IDE [17].
0.10472133	Following a previous observation where somatostatin directly interacts with IDE, here we demonstrate that somatostatin regulates A? catabolism by modulating IDE proteolytic activity in IDE gene-silencing experiments.
=========================================================
========================================================
Question: Which method was applied to measure the quantity of IDE mRNA in the gene regulation experiments described in the paper?
1.1177425	A time-course investigation reveals that IDE mRNA increases linearly with the sst concentration within 5 hrs to incubation and turns back after 24 hrs, suggesting a transcriptional effect triggered by sst in BV2 cells (Figure 2A).
0.2898186	Find this article online Bradford MM (1976) A rapid and sensitive method for the quantitation of microgram quantities of protein utilizing the principle of protein-dye binding.
0.14130466	(A) IDE mRNA increases after 5 hrs of incubation with somatostatin (white columns); 24 hrs after incubation, the level is similar to the control (grey columns).
0.11013552	Materials and Methods Top Materials
0.08831541	Somatostatin triggers IDE gene transcription and protein which displays a different turnover rate: IDE-mRNA reaches a maximum of transcription within 5 hrs after stimulation, returning to the basal level within 24 hrs, whereas the protein concentration increases in cell lysates and supernatants at later times, being still clearly evident after 24 hrs.

Question: What regulates the production of neprilysin?
1.5876575	In addition to their ability to phagocyte ?-amyloid, microglia can also clear A? by degradation through the production of A?-degrading enzymes, such as IDE, neprilysin and MMP-9 [29], [33], [39].
0.7781162	Somatostatin seems to be also involved in the regulation of neprilysin activity by affecting its expression and its synaptic localization [22].
0.5446814	Several proteases, such as insulin-degrading-enzyme (IDE), neprilysin (NEP) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) are involved in A? degradation [4]–[6].
0.42710978	IDE concentration was determined by using a TMB colorimetric kit according to product instructions.

Question: What kind of glial cell is able to phagocyte b-amyloid?
0.22204429	A layer of astrocytic cells was obtained through the vigorous shaking of a confluent 10-day-old monolayer of mixed glial cells [34].
0.22204429	Primary cultures of glial cells were prepared from 2-day-old newborn rats (Sprague–Dawley, Charles River, Calco, Italy).

Question: What substance exhibited a similar effect on  IDE secretion as achieved by somatostatin?
1.8030732	This result indicates that somatostatin acts not only by modulating IDE expression, but also by affecting IDE secretion and increasing the amount of the enzyme in the extracellular space.
1.673131	Interestingly, we also observed that in astrocytes, incubation with somatostatin does not have any significant detectable effect of IDE expression, reinforcing the physiological relevance of somatostatin action on IDE secretion in microglia cells.
1.3735847	g002 Somatostatin effect on IDE secretion
1.1321777	Through this pathway, somatostatin enhances IDE secretion, strengthening the pool of active enzymes which interact with ?-amyloid and other IDE extracellular substrates.
0.8233558	Modulation of IDE expression by somatostatin.
0.7671416	Somatostatin analogue octreotide increases IDE expression and secretion.
0.7671416	It is known that IDE and somatostatin levels are altered in AD progression [3], [20].
0.7429832	Following a previous observation where somatostatin directly interacts with IDE, here we demonstrate that somatostatin regulates A? catabolism by modulating IDE proteolytic activity in IDE gene-silencing experiments.
0.7390344	Here, we show that, like somatostatin, octreotide increases IDE expression and secretion, although the effects are generally reduced compared to the endogenous modulator.
0.7390344	As a whole, the reported data indicate that somatostatin regulates IDE expression, secretion and catalytic activity in microglia.

Question: What are the sst receptors that are expressed on rat astrocytes?
4.7222533	In order to assess whether the effect of sst on IDE expression is a microglia characteristic, rat astrocytes which display three sst receptor subtypes as well (SSTR-1, SSTR-2, and SSTR-4) [37] were incubated with the same somatostatin concentrations (Figure S1).
0.9019369	Rat Astrocytes were incubated with indicated concentrations of somatostatin.
=========================================================
========================================================
Question: What method was used to inhibit the expression of IDE?
1.9810649	This addition further amplifies the positive modulation of IDE expression (Figure 1).
1.9810649	Somatostatin induces an increase of IDE expression in microglia cells.
1.9810649	To this purpose, IDE expression was silenced through a siRNA-based approach.
1.8380933	IDE level was analyzed by Western blotting in cell lysates collected after 24 hrs of sst incubation and as indicated in Figure S1, no detectable modulation of IDE expression was observed.
1.7625325	Modulation of IDE expression by somatostatin.
1.734304	Therefore, these findings indicate that octreotide and sst exert a very similar effect on IDE expression and secretion in BV-2 cells (see Figures 1, 2 and 4).
1.734304	It is thus conceivable that sst depletion results in a decrease of IDE expression and secretion contributing to the pathological deposition of ?-amyloid in the brain.
1.734304	Therefore, this evidence mightexplain the discrepancy between sst and its analogue concerning the positive modulation of IDE expression, even though additional factors cannot be ruled out.
1.734304	Western blot analysis of normalized lysis samples indicates that no detectable effect of IDE expression is observed (left panel).

Question: In which anatomical structure in the brain does amyloid-beta aggregate?
0.060954183	Increased oxidative stress levels have been found in the brains of patients with AD in Sweden and early in Tg2576 APP transgenic mice [12, 13].
0.060954183	Accumulation of amyloid-beta in AD brains is thought to underlie neuronal dysfunction and memory loss, being centrally implicated in AD pathogenesis.
0.060954183	Studies of postmortem brains from AD patients and transgenic mouse models of AD suggest that oxidative damage, induced by amyloid-beta, is associated with mitochondria early in AD progression.
0.060954183	The brain is vulnerable to oxidative stress owing to its high lipid content, its relatively high oxygen metabolism, and its low levels of antioxidant defenses [26].
0.060954183	Mitochondrial abnormalities have been found both in neurons and astrocytes [35–37], suggesting that both neurons and astrocytes might be damaged by free radicals in the AD brain.
0.060954183	Oxidative stress was also reported in the mitochondria of other tissues different to the brain such as platelets and fibroblasts from AD patients [29, 30].
0.053334914	Moreover, previous to mitochondrial accumulation of amyloid-beta showed in AD patient and AD transgenic mouse brain, the toxic amyloid-beta species has to be accumulated in the cytosol of the cells.
0.04571564	Moreover, we summarize evidence from AD postmortem brain as well as animal AD models showing that amyloid-beta triggers mitochondrial dysfunction through a number of pathways such as impairment of oxidative phosphorylation, elevation of reactive oxygen species production, alteration of mitochondrial dynamics, and interaction with mitochondrial proteins.

Question: Which protein is able to block nitric oxide creation?
0.04973717	Although mitochondria have the ability to produce proteins, the vast majority of proteins that function within the mitochondria, including those involved in DNA transcription, translation, and repair, are encoded by nuclear DNA and are transported into the mitochondria from the cytosol.
0.04568651	Both proteins are known to localize to mitochondrial membranes, block thetransport of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins to mitochondria, interact with mitochondrial proteins, disrupt the electron transport chain, increase reactive oxygen species production, cause mitochondrial damage, and prevent neurons from functioning normally.
0.04568651	Amyloid-beta and APP protein are known to localize to mitochondrial membranes, block the transport of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins to mitochondria, interact with mitochondrial proteins, disrupt the electron transport chain, increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, cause mitochondrial damage, and prevent neurons from functioning normally.
0.043961864	The remaining genes encode transfer (22 genes) and ribosomal (2 genes) RNA allowing the mitochondria to generate their own proteins.
0.043520026	Mitochondria were found to be the target both for amyloid precursor protein (APP) that accumulates in the mitochondrial import channels and for amyloid-beta that interacts with several proteins inside mitochondria and leads to mitochondrial dysfunction [30].
0.035169493	Intermembrane space contains proapoptotic proteins like cytochrome c, Smac/Diablo, EndoG, and Htra2/Omi.
0.035169493	Complexes I, III, and IV are located in inner mitochondrial membrane as integral proteins, whereas complex II is attached to the inner surface of this membrane.
0.035169493	H2O2 and superoxide radicals, released from the mitochondrial matrix and from the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes, might be carried to the cytoplasm and, ultimately, might lead to the oxidation of cytoplasmic proteins [26].
0.030773308	The recent emphasis on the intracellular biology of amyloid-beta and its precursor protein (APP) has led researchers to consider the possibility that mitochondria-associated and mitochondrial amyloid-beta may directly cause neurotoxicity.
0.030457674	In previous studies with choroid plexus homogenates with different cases with AD in the different stages (I/0, III-IV, and V-VI), we demonstrated that in AD patients, amyloid-beta peptide also accumulates in choroid plexus [15], there is an oxidation of carboxymethyl-lysine (CML), and N-carboxyethyl-lysine (CEL) may result in impaired protein interactions, protein folding, and protein kinase activity; abnormal function of endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells; impaired HDL-cholesterol metabolism in the choroid plexus in advanced stages of AD [16].2.

Question: Which is the best-characterized factor that increases chances of getting AD?
0.07473229	The most widely recognized is AD, which is among the principal debilitating conditions of the current century.
0.07473229	mtDNA defects have also been linked to an increased incidence of AD [32].
0.07396579	Studies of postmortem brains from AD patients and transgenic mouse models of AD suggest that oxidative damage, induced by amyloid-beta, is associated with mitochondria early in AD progression.
0.06039281	Oxidative stress plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of AD and is intimately linked to aging, the best established risk factor for AD.

Question: When APH1 genes are overexpressed in MEF KO what happens with the AŒ≤?
1.7763338	When compared to APH1aS or L, overexpression of APH1b in MEF knockout for all APH1 genes led to increased production of longer A? species [24].
1.0347286	Indeed, ?-secretase complexes are heterogeneous in composition due to the existence of two human APH1 genes, APH1a and APH1b, and two splicing isoforms of APH1a (S and L), as well as two presenilin genes, PSEN1 and PSEN2.

0.04811721	Together with nicastrin (NCT), anterior pharynx-defective protein 1 (APH1), and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2), the catalytic subunit PS1 constitutes the core of the ?-secretase complex and contributes to the proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) into amyloid-beta (A?) peptides.
0.04811721	The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is processed by the successive actions of ?-secretase (BACE1) and ?-secretase, generating amyloid-beta peptides (A?) of different lengths, ranging from 37 to 46 amino acids [10].
0.04811721	WT MEF, ?-MEF and ? - PS1/2 were transduced with an APP-based substrate corresponding to the 99 C-terminal residues of human APP fused to the APP signal peptide in N-terminus (SPA4CT [36]) and a Flag Tag in C-terminus.

Question: What mutation of the PS1 protein causes Œ≥-secretase activity almost to disappear?
0.23434101	Our biochemical and functional findings strongly suggest that pathogenic mutations in PSEN1 cause a loss of ?-secretase activity.
0.1874728	Together, our results strongly support the hypothesis that the pathogenic L166P, ?E9, and P436Q mutations in PSEN1 cause a drastic loss (at least 90% as estimated by ELISA) of ?-secretase activity.
0.1406046	The functional characterization of these complexes revealed that all PS1 FAD-linked mutations caused a loss of ?-secretase activity phenotype, in terms of A?1–40, A?1–42 and APP intracellular domain productions in vitro.
0.1406046	Although a poor recovery of ?-secretase activity for the PS1-L166P and a comparatively better performance of PS1-?E9 have been reported by others under similar experimental conditions [23], the potential of PS1-P436Q mutation to restore the processing of endogenous APP-CTFs has never been assessed [34], [35].
0.1406046	To assess how FAD-linked mutations in PS1 affect ?-secretase activity in these purified complexes, we performed in vitro assays by using C100-Flag substrate (Figure 3A) and equal amounts of the different purified complexes, immediately after the purification to avoid freezing/thawing cycles that might affect enzymatic activity.

0.118944876	In vitro ?-secretase activity assays were performed as previously described [27].
0.08496063	They further support the concept that modulating rather than inhibiting ?-secretase activity would be a more appropriate therapeutic strategy for AD [58].
0.08496063	The relative amounts of AICD-Flag generated in the reactions, reflecting ?-secretase activity, were estimated by densitometry.
0.0679685	Similarly, we found a near to complete loss of ?-secretase activity for complexes with the aggressive PS1-P436Q mutant (mean onset: 28.3 years) [54].

Question: How many mutations relevant for familial forms of Alzheimer's disease have been detected for the PSEN1 gene?
0.8204544	Mutations linked to early onset, familial forms of Alzheimer's disease (FAD) are found most frequently in PSEN1, the gene encoding presenilin-1 (PS1).
0.13342878	g005 Discussion Top Several conflicting results as to how Alzheimer's disease-linked mutations in PSEN1 affect the processing of APP by ?-secretase have been reported.
0.13342878	This deleterious dual effect might explain why FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations cause early onset Alzheimer's disease.
0.13342878	Alzheimer's Disease-Linked Mutations in Presenilin-1 Result in a Drastic Loss of Activity in Purified ?-Secretase Complexes
0.11675018	Our data support the view that PS1 mutations lead to a strong ?-secretase loss-of-function phenotype and an increased A?1–42/A?1–40 ratio, two mechanisms that are potentially involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.
0.11675018	Introduction Top Since their discovery in 1995 and their association with early onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) [1], [2], the presenilin genes PSEN1 and PSEN2 have been widely studied, and the complexity of their biological role is becoming increasingly evident.

0.026894707	It was initially suggested that such mutations lead to a toxic gain of function because they are associated with a relative increased production of longer and more hydrophobic A? species, mainly A?1–42, that accumulate and aggregate early in the course of the disease [15], [16].
0.015368404	Next, the clone expressing the highest levels of all three recombinant proteins was selected (designated ? - PS1/2) and used as the parental cell line that was further transduced with lentivectors carrying the following different human PS1 variants: PS1-WT, three dominant-negative forms of PS1 that lack the crucial, catalytic site aspartate residues (D257A, D385A, and both D257A/D385A referred to as DDAA later in the article), and three FAD-linked PS1 mutants (L166P, ?E9 and P436Q, with mean disease onset at 24 years, 45.5 years and 28.3 years, respectively).
