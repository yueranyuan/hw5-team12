179*********************
0.013781285	Moreover, variability in these factors could facilitate or obscure the SNP association with CLU1 expression described here, suggesting that replication of these data in additional samples is necessary for their acceptance by the research community.
166*********************
0.013762912	The most parsimonious interpretation of these data is that CLU1 translation is generally initiated at the common exon 2 ATG.

0.041574046	A logical extension of the finding that AD risk is reduced with a genetic variant that correlates with increased CLU expression is that other factors that increase CLU expression may also reduce AD risk.

20*********************
0.14096247	Additional reported isoforms include a CLU isoform that lacks exon 5 and a CLU isoform that lacks exon two, which encodes the leader sequence, resulting in another nuclear clusterin [21], [22].
44*********************
0.14096247	Note that the CLU1 sense primer contains the TATA sequence suggested by Schepeler et al to be present only in a longer ‚ÄúCLU34‚Äù isoform [31].

0.10862518	It is known that a small fraction of IDE (ranging from 3% to 10%) is secreted into the extracellular space, where it presumably interacts with its substrates, such as insulin and Œ≤-amyloid [8], [38].
18*********************
0.06386572	Notably, IDE is a zinc metalloendopeptidase that hydrolyzes a wide range of substrates, including insulin, amylin, glucagon, atrial natriuretic factor and insulin-like growth factors I and II [8].

0.0510191	Insulin-degrading-enzyme (IDE) is one of the main extracellular protease targeting AŒ≤, and thus it represents an interesting pharmacological target for AD therapy.

59*********************
0.05803914	Amyloid-beta and APP protein are known to localize to mitochondrial membranes, block the transport of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins to mitochondria, interact with mitochondrial proteins, disrupt the electron transport chain, increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, cause mitochondrial damage, and prevent neurons from functioning normally.
20*********************

0.25051945	They found decreased self-renewal and differentiation of neuronal precursor cells in the subventricular zone, suggesting that the loss-of-function phenotype of PSEN1 mutations can also be observed in heterogeneous conditions.
259*********************
0.2207146	In vitro Œ≥-secretase activity assays were performed as previously described [27].
26*********************
0.18987165	In addition, PS1 has been shown to interact with a growing list of proteins that modulate Œ≥-secretase activity [9], [12], [13], [14].
193*********************
0.18987165	These include TMP21 or the recently reported Œ≥-secretase activating protein (GSAP) [12], [13].
78*********************
0.18678239	As estimated by ELISA, a three-fold increase in AŒ≤1‚Äì40 and AŒ≤1‚Äì42 levels was observed in the cell culture media of cell lines overexpressing human Œ≥-secretase (Œ≥-MEF WT), in comparison to untransduced WT MEFs (Figure 2B).
68*********************
0.18673332	As expected, and as indicated by increased levels of intracellular APP-CTFs (a common characteristic among known substrates in response to Œ≥-secretase pharmacological inhibition), the activity of Œ≥-secretase was significantly altered in the PS deficient parental Œ≥ - PS1/2 cell line as well as in all clones expressing dominant negative forms of PS1 (Figure 1B).
73*********************
0.18544492	These data suggest that the effect of FAD mutations in PS1 on APP-CTFs accumulation was similar in presence or absence of other human components of the Œ≥-secretase.
181*********************
0.18455762	Interestingly, the same study also reported that P436Q variant showed a decreased Œ≥-secretase activity and AŒ≤40 and AŒ≤42 secretion in PS1/PS2 double knockout cells (~75% or ~50% of the control for AŒ≤40 or AŒ≤42, respectively), but to a lesser extent than what we measured in this study (more than 97% for both AŒ≤ species).
263*********************
0.18348715	Purified Œ≥-secretase was resolved by electrophoresis on NativePAGE‚Ñ¢ Novex¬Æ Bis-Tris 4‚Äì16% Gels for Blue Native (BN)-PAGE analysis (Invitrogen).
24*********************
0.18300621	The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is processed by the successive actions of Œ≤-secretase (BACE1) and Œ≥-secretase, generating amyloid-beta peptides (AŒ≤) of different lengths, ranging from 37 to 46 amino acids [10].

160*********************
0.45689362	When compared to APH1aS or L, overexpression of APH1b in MEF knockout for all APH1 genes led to increased production of longer AŒ≤ species [24].
157*********************
0.2785638	Indeed, Œ≥-secretase complexes are heterogeneous in composition due to the existence of two human APH1 genes, APH1a and APH1b, and two splicing isoforms of APH1a (S and L), as well as two presenilin genes, PSEN1 and PSEN2.
114*********************
0.17508836	However, in the latter, the ratio may have been overestimated because the AŒ≤1‚Äì40 levels measured were at the detection limit.
103*********************
0.05924937	(C) AŒ≤1‚Äì40 and AŒ≤1‚Äì42 were quantified by sandwich ELISA and represented in pg/mL (left Y-axis) or in percentage (right Y-axis) of the mean of AŒ≤1‚Äì40 levels generated by the two wild-type clones.
80*********************
0.052103806	First, only traces of both AŒ≤1‚Äì40 and AŒ≤1‚Äì42 were detected in Œ≥-MEFs overexpressing PS1 with aspartate mutants.
169*********************
0.051941905	These results are consistent with our in vitro data, although the reduction in AŒ≤1‚Äì42 and AŒ≤1‚Äì40 production was more pronounced in our system.
170*********************
0.051496755	However, they differ from our cell-based data in which we observed an increase in AŒ≤1‚Äì42 associated with a decrease in AŒ≤1‚Äì40.
168*********************
0.05090021	In contrast, Bentahir and colleagues found that PS1-L166P decreased both AŒ≤1‚Äì40 and AŒ≤1‚Äì42 production in a PS knockout background.
9*********************
0.050355636	The functional characterization of these complexes revealed that all PS1 FAD-linked mutations caused a loss of Œ≥-secretase activity phenotype, in terms of AŒ≤1‚Äì40, AŒ≤1‚Äì42 and APP intracellular domain productions in vitro.
128*********************
0.049858507	Next, sandwich ELISAs directed against AŒ≤1‚Äì40 and AŒ≤1‚Äì42 were performed in order to further characterize the specific activity of the purified complexes.
