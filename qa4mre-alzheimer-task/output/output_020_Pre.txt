Question: Which technique was used to determine the cellular locations of the CLU1 and CLU2 gene products?
101*********************
0.22934115	Within B, the value in parentheses following the tissue name is the CLU1:CLU2 ratio.
138*********************
0.20805179	Importantly, this 5.1 kDa size difference between endogenous and transfected clusterin is similar to the size difference between the CLU1 and CLU2-predicted proteins, indicating that if the proteins encoded by CLU1 and CLU2 differed by 5 kDa, the proteins would be resolved easily under these experimental conditions.
166*********************
0.03591841	The most parsimonious interpretation of these data is that CLU1 translation is generally initiated at the common exon 2 ATG.
167*********************
0.034235876	The possibility exists that a portion of CLU1 translation is initiated at the exon 1a ATG at levels too low to be readily detected or that produce an unstable protein which is rapidly degraded.
179*********************
0.034235876	Moreover, variability in these factors could facilitate or obscure the SNP association with CLU1 expression described here, suggesting that replication of these data in additional samples is necessary for their acceptance by the research community.
109*********************
0.03263999	Since the minor rs11136000T allele was associated with both increased CLU1 expression and reduced AD risk [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], we interpret these results as suggesting that increased CLU1 expression is associated with reduced AD risk.
23*********************
0.031346813	Quantitative expression studies show that both CLU1 and CLU2 are increased in AD but only CLU1 is associated with rs11136000.
145*********************
0.031346813	Second, the expression of only CLU1 was associated with rs11136000 while both CLU1 and CLU2 were increased with robust AD neuropathology.
87*********************
0.03104291	The predicted protein sequences encoded by CLU1 and CLU2, beginning with the initial ATG sites shown in A, are shown in panel C. The sequence in gray font is unique to CLU1 while sequence in black font is common to CLU1 and CLU2.
108*********************

Question: What compartments inside the cell contain clusterin proteins?
136*********************
1.4427694	g004 To evaluate whether the clusterin proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 in vitro are similar to those produced in vivo, we compared ectopic clusterin with endogenous clusterin in SH-SY5Y cells and in human brain by Western blotting with a clusterin antibody.
128*********************
1.2262615	CLU1 and CLU2 produce clusterin proteins that are similar to each other and to clusterin in human brain.
146*********************
1.186316	Third, CLU1 and CLU2 produce secreted clusterin proteins that are similar to each other and to clusterin in human brain.
135*********************
0.9960511	Overall, the cellular clusterin proteins are similar in size to the human brain clusterin, as discerned for the intact and cleaved clusterin under reducing conditions (D) or as the heterodimeric clusterin under non-reducing conditions (E).
133*********************
0.89093226	When transfected and endogenous clusterin proteins were detected with an antibody raised against a carboxyl-terminal clusterin epitope (D‚ÄìE), intact clusterin from transfection (T-labeled arrow) was slightly larger than endogenous clusterin (E-labeled arrow), reflecting the ~5.1 kDa V5 epitope and His tags in the ectopic clusterin (D).
165*********************
0.75090355	Comparable results were obtained in two cell types, suggesting that CLU1 and CLU2 generally produce soluble clusterin protein.
122*********************
0.70500004	Cell lysates contained both intact and cleaved clusterin while conditioned medium contained only cleaved clusterin; the clusterin protein produced by CLU1 and CLU2 appeared equal in size (Figure 4A).
182*********************
0.48074266	Both CLU1 and CLU2 produce a soluble, secreted clusterin protein that is similar to that observed in human brain.
153*********************
0.41066343	We note that the lack of an association between total CLU and rs11136000 was similar to prior reports that total CLU mRNA or clusterin protein were not associated with rs11136000 [17], [34].
16*********************
0.3574027	Although the primary role of clusterin in AD is unclear, CLU is implicated in AD by several lines of evidence, including (I) CLU mRNA and clusterin protein is increased in AD [5], [6], (ii) clusterin is a component of plaques [4], [5], [7], (iii) clusterin modulates AD-related pathways such as inflammation and apoptosis [1], [8], [9] and (iv) clusterin acts as an amyloid-beta (A√ü) chaperone to alter A√ü aggregation and/or clearance ([10], [11], reviewed in [4], [12], [13], [14]).

Question: What substance exhibited a similar effect on  IDE secretion as achieved by somatostatin?
128*********************
1.7975312	Therefore, these findings indicate that octreotide and sst exert a very similar effect on IDE expression and secretion in BV-2 cells (see Figures 1, 2 and 4).
106*********************
1.3146112	g002 Somatostatin effect on IDE secretion
110*********************
0.80977905	This result indicates that somatostatin acts not only by modulating IDE expression, but also by affecting IDE secretion and increasing the amount of the enzyme in the extracellular space.
169*********************
0.7762306	Interestingly, we also observed that in astrocytes, incubation with somatostatin does not have any significant detectable effect of IDE expression, reinforcing the physiological relevance of somatostatin action on IDE secretion in microglia cells.

Question: What effect can be observed when when Œ≥-secretase is blocked? 
73*********************
0.46663827	These data suggest that the effect of FAD mutations in PS1 on APP-CTFs accumulation was similar in presence or absence of other human components of the Œ≥-secretase.
199*********************
0.427522	They found decreased self-renewal and differentiation of neuronal precursor cells in the subventricular zone, suggesting that the loss-of-function phenotype of PSEN1 mutations can also be observed in heterogeneous conditions.
193*********************
0.35598937	These include TMP21 or the recently reported Œ≥-secretase activating protein (GSAP) [12], [13].
26*********************
0.3353122	In addition, PS1 has been shown to interact with a growing list of proteins that modulate Œ≥-secretase activity [9], [12], [13], [14].
78*********************
0.33092326	As estimated by ELISA, a three-fold increase in AŒ≤1‚Äì40 and AŒ≤1‚Äì42 levels was observed in the cell culture media of cell lines overexpressing human Œ≥-secretase (Œ≥-MEF WT), in comparison to untransduced WT MEFs (Figure 2B).
263*********************
0.3301429	Purified Œ≥-secretase was resolved by electrophoresis on NativePAGE‚Ñ¢ Novex¬Æ Bis-Tris 4‚Äì16% Gels for Blue Native (BN)-PAGE analysis (Invitrogen).
24*********************
0.32392192	The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is processed by the successive actions of Œ≤-secretase (BACE1) and Œ≥-secretase, generating amyloid-beta peptides (AŒ≤) of different lengths, ranging from 37 to 46 amino acids [10].
150*********************
0.3234488	g005 Discussion Top Several conflicting results as to how Alzheimer's disease-linked mutations in PSEN1 affect the processing of APP by Œ≥-secretase have been reported.
68*********************
0.32245132	As expected, and as indicated by increased levels of intracellular APP-CTFs (a common characteristic among known substrates in response to Œ≥-secretase pharmacological inhibition), the activity of Œ≥-secretase was significantly altered in the PS deficient parental Œ≥ - PS1/2 cell line as well as in all clones expressing dominant negative forms of PS1 (Figure 1B).
181*********************
0.3198043	Interestingly, the same study also reported that P436Q variant showed a decreased Œ≥-secretase activity and AŒ≤40 and AŒ≤42 secretion in PS1/PS2 double knockout cells (~75% or ~50% of the control for AŒ≤40 or AŒ≤42, respectively), but to a lesser extent than what we measured in this study (more than 97% for both AŒ≤ species).

4: transition-state analogue, 0.59064174
-- Experimental evidence such as the binding of transition-state analogue Œ≥-secretase inhibitors to PS1 [4], as well as the abolishment of Œ≥-secretase activity when PS1 lacks the aspartate residues critical for proteolysis [4], [5], [6], have confirmed that presenilins harbour the active site of the enzymatic complex.

Question: When APH1 genes are overexpressed in MEF KO what happens with the AŒ≤?
160*********************
1.0194504	When compared to APH1aS or L, overexpression of APH1b in MEF knockout for all APH1 genes led to increased production of longer AŒ≤ species [24].
157*********************
0.5565545	Indeed, Œ≥-secretase complexes are heterogeneous in composition due to the existence of two human APH1 genes, APH1a and APH1b, and two splicing isoforms of APH1a (S and L), as well as two presenilin genes, PSEN1 and PSEN2.
114*********************
0.3626716	However, in the latter, the ratio may have been overestimated because the AŒ≤1‚Äì40 levels measured were at the detection limit.
103*********************
0.12599304	(C) AŒ≤1‚Äì40 and AŒ≤1‚Äì42 were quantified by sandwich ELISA and represented in pg/mL (left Y-axis) or in percentage (right Y-axis) of the mean of AŒ≤1‚Äì40 levels generated by the two wild-type clones.
80*********************
0.106733635	First, only traces of both AŒ≤1‚Äì40 and AŒ≤1‚Äì42 were detected in Œ≥-MEFs overexpressing PS1 with aspartate mutants.
113*********************
0.106733635	Interestingly, an overall AŒ≤1‚Äì42/AŒ≤1‚Äì40 ratio of ~1 was estimated for all PS1 mutants, with the exception of P436Q#4 (~2).
128*********************
0.106733635	Next, sandwich ELISAs directed against AŒ≤1‚Äì40 and AŒ≤1‚Äì42 were performed in order to further characterize the specific activity of the purified complexes.
168*********************
0.106733635	In contrast, Bentahir and colleagues found that PS1-L166P decreased both AŒ≤1‚Äì40 and AŒ≤1‚Äì42 production in a PS knockout background.
169*********************
0.106733635	These results are consistent with our in vitro data, although the reduction in AŒ≤1‚Äì42 and AŒ≤1‚Äì40 production was more pronounced in our system.
170*********************

21*********************
2.144875	PS1 and PS2 play fundamental roles in cell signalling as part of the Œ≥-secretase complex.

0.15712881	This deleterious dual effect might explain why FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations cause early onset Alzheimer's disease.
17*********************
0.15181117	Introduction Top Since their discovery in 1995 and their association with early onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) [1], [2], the presenilin genes PSEN1 and PSEN2 have been widely studied, and the complexity of their biological role is becoming increasingly evident.
10*********************
0.14649352	Our data support the view that PS1 mutations lead to a strong Œ≥-secretase loss-of-function phenotype and an increased AŒ≤1‚Äì42/AŒ≤1‚Äì40 ratio, two mechanisms that are potentially involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.
